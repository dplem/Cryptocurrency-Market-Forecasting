### Problem Statement:

Using the comments of the r/Bitcoin subreddit and the historical bitcoin price, can we predict whether the price of bitcoin will decrease or increase for the following day?

### Background:

The price of Bitcoin and many other cryptocurrencies has been historically, very volitile. If there was a way to forecast the upward or downward trend of the market even to a few percentage points above random, it could be extrememly valuable. If the market is a reflection of peoples buying power, could it not be possible to predict the market using individuals sentiment about a product, in this case, Bitcoin? 

While being able to predict the market patterns for cryptocurrency would be useful, we can also evaluate which social media platform is most reflective of actual market sentiment. In other words, which social media platform is useful. it will also be interesting to see what are the capabilities of machine learning tools to make such predictions.

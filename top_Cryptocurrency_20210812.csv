All he cares it’s his ego and his companies.

Lately, we’ve seen a lot of hate towards Mark Zuckerberg from Facebook. Is sweet Elon Musk different? Maybe he isn’t lizardy as Marky is, because he is skrull from Mars. Is Elon any different compared to Mark? Both of them are shilling their own companies, Tesla isn’t different. Just because he offers you to buy Tesla with BTC, it doesn’t mean that he is on your side. He isn’t helping you, he is helping himself. 

While you’re laughing at him shilling DOGE, he is laughing at you how is he manipulating you. He is not helping crypto, he is hurting it. He isn’t same as you or me, he doesn’t have to save money for food, he doesn’t have the count if he has enough for dinner. 

He isn’t on your side, every one of the billionaires are trying to manipulate as much people as they can, to make them believe in theirs own visions and dreams. Just because he pumped your coin, it doesn’t mean that he is your lovely neighbour. 

Elon shouldn’t be used as a model for crypto. Just because he was on Joe Rogan podcast, it isn’t making him a proper role model.

A wallet is not what you think it is,20838,n1vwak,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n1vwak/a_wallet_is_not_what_you_think_it_is/,MagoCrypto,1619795431.0,False,CLIENT,t3_n1vwak,False,1754,False,0.94,"If you're new to the space, here is a quick 101 on wallets.

Metamask, Electrum, MEW, Trust, Coinomi, Atomic or whatever other application you call a wallet is not really a wallet.

They are **wallet applications** that allow you to access and manage your cryptocurrency, NFTs or whatever blockchain asset you have stored in your wallet.

**Your wallet is your private key or seed phrase.**

For example:

* You download Metamask
* It gives you the option to create a seed phrase/private key
* The same seed phrase you can import to other applications like Trust, MEW, Atomic and your ETH will be accessible on both Metamask and those applications.

So next time you download a new wallet application, you don't have to create a new seed phrase, you can just import the one you already have to manage your existing funds in both applications.

Just thought I'd share this since I work in crypto and I noticed that a lot of users don't know this.

EDIT: I felt obliged to add that this is the reason you should never ever share your private keys with anyone. Your keys are your sole access to your assets on the blockchain so keep them secure.

Happy Friday!"
I made a post about the scam OpisHub yesterday. The scammers didn't like that and bought downvotes to make my post invisible. So this is an even more detailed post about them.,20797,o7k0b4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o7k0b4/i_made_a_post_about_the_scam_opishub_yesterday/,_martinshkreli_,1624612019.0,False,WARNING,t3_o7k0b4,False,610,False,0.93,"Yesterday I made [a post](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o6zy0e/scam_warning_if_you_see_posts_praising_opishub_on/) about OpisHub. It's still up, but the main point was that they approached me to shill their shitcoin for money and that they are really shady, it has many red flags and very much looks like a scam.

Then one of the scammers (Scammer 2) sent me a message that he didn't like it, and that I was deleting his comments on my post (lol he has less than 50 comment karma, they just got deleted, of course I didn't do anything). My post only had like 35 or 50 upvotes at this point and it had already been 2 hours since I posted, the post wouldn't have become very big - but the scammers decided to buy downvotes, bringing it to below 0 within minutes, [see also here](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o75scd/the_scammers_behind_opishub_didnt_like_the_post_i/h2wxc7e/). The mods deleted a post about this that I made yesterday (because it broke another rule, so I understand - but that post is probably also the reason why my original post is above 0 again), so here I go again: these guys are obviously shady, some examples:

* one of them (the one that originally approached me, Scammer 1), [pretended to have just stumbled across the project](https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/) instead of saying that he was part of the project **EDIT:** just saw that the post was deleted, it's archived [here](https://web.archive.org/web/20210429143341/https://old.reddit.com/r/beermoneyuk/comments/n15mwk/passive_phone_gains_opishub/)
* they wanted to pay me (and most likely others) to shill their project
* they [openly told me](https://imgur.com/a/rgw1HsB) they would do vote manipulation and upvote my posts about them and then, well, bought downvotes

So even if the coin would not be a total scam - which I really think it is - they are obviously doing shady stuff. I have already listed the obvious red flags that make them look like your average scam coin, here they are again, slightly adapted:

* they use your phone's CPU for mining
* the CPU is used to power scientific research (of course they don't say what ""scientific research"" they are talking about anywhere). And I work in science: of course I would rather use the CPU of a few phones than, well, the powerful computers we have, just as much as I would rather ride a few cats that are tied together than a horse
* ""each transaction gives a small % to charity""
* they plan to be super eco friendly and plant trees
* ""our primary promotional point is that it adds people's incentive to get  their friends and family on board , therefore we will have a reffer@l scheme in place"", so it's officially a pyramid scheme
* the token (and app) will launch soon ™

Scammer 1 had also told me they ""have received £3.5million pounds in the last week to utilise to get this project off the ground"". If you look at their social media activity etc., it's all extremely basic and unprofessional (but check out their Twitter, it's kind of funny - they really try to seem ""sciency"" but don't really know anything about science I think. The followers are either also bought or baited by some fake giveaways, very few seem to be normal, non-spammy accounts) - no company with multiple millions funding would present themselves like that. Also look at the [start of the email](https://imgur.com/a/tbq5YZ9) they sent me in beautiful red, Scammer 1 didn't even remove the ""initial contact"", which I think is hilarious.

So again, if you see positive posts about this project, it's either the scammers or people with less morals that they approached. Stay away from them as far as possible, at least don't give them money, your personal information, or go to their website/ download their app so they can send you viruses."

* **In order for the Market Cap (Top Number) to go up, many people would have to buy dogecoin**, but many people understand this is a meme coin or a pump/dump coin. They are using this as short term profit or self entertainment because there is no long term adoptation compare to other crypto currency projects.
* **In order for the Circulating Supply (Bottom Number) to go down, they would have to stop mining dogecoin**, but there is 14.4 Dogecoins being produced in one day which is 5 Billion Dogecoin a year.

&#x200B;

* **If you want DogeCoin to be $10** based on the circulating supply we have now, then the **Market Cap would have to be 1.29 Trillion** *(Note: I calculated this several days back, so the number might be even higher now)*, **that's if DOGECOIN STOPPED MINING and NEVER MAKE ANYMORE!**

* **Dogecoin would have to overtake Facebook and Tesla!**

&#x200B;

**Once again, this is if Dogecoin stopped mining right now and produced no more Dogecoin supply, but Dogecoin will produce to infinity, it will not stop producing because there is no cap.**

&#x200B;

**This is like trying to mop a wet floor that has a water leak and the water leak will never stop leaking. Yes, you can recruit more workers to mop the floor, but at some point the workers will quit and leave, then you are left mopping the water by yourself and eventually you will drown in the water.**

Someone who believes in the project will ride it out too, they will understand you taking profits, they will be confident someone else will buy in. They will generally behave in an encouraging manner.

People need an asset that they know can't be arbitrarily printed or controlled by corrupt governments.

And after 12 years, this narrative is taking hold. The financial industry is starting to take Bitcoin seriously, investors and large corporations are putting Bitcoin on their balance sheet to reduce their dependency on the behavior of the US federal government.

**But the next fight is upon us.**

This week, the common folk of the internet discovered their power. They discovered that by working together, they can challenge the powerful entities of Wall Street.

And Wall Street hates it.

As of right now, Robinhood and most other trading products are in ""reduce only mode"".

Wall Street has decided that you're not responsible enough to buy the stocks that you like, so they've taken away your stock buying privileges.

Of course, hedge funds will still have access to GME and AMC. But not you.

**This is why Bitcoin is only the beginning of this revolution.**

It's not simply enough to be able to custody your own assets. You need to be able to trade them, to lend them, to leverage them. You should have access to the same financial instruments that the rich people on Wall Street have access to.

**This is why we need DeFi**

Nobody can turn off Uniswap. Nobody can turn off Aave. Nobody can turn off Synthetix.

Nobody can tell you that leverage-longing some shitcoin is irresponsible and you're not allowed to do it.

While I have your attention, I want to take 5 seconds of your time and bring some exposure to something that is threatening our existence as the human race. If you aren't interested, please skip down to the main article. I'm talking about finding a way to live sustainably on this planet, regenerative agriculture, where we get our food from, and how we can make sure that our kids and grandkids have something left once we leave. 

Please consider reading up on Permaculture, sustainable living, Forest gardening, Backyard Chickens, etc. Consider following what I did and do it for yourself. [This all used to be a useless lawn.](https://youtu.be/U79bql-JSqI)

[Bored for a night? Go watch ""Sustainable"" on Netflix.](https://sustainablefoodfilm.com/) 

Look into people like [Geoff Lawton](http://www.geofflawtononline.com/), Mark Shepard, Sepp Holzer, these people are going to save us. 

Want to make a small change yourself? Grow a tomato plant on your balcony in a pot. Reduce transport of the tomatoes you eat, and make ~$50 per plant in saved money. Want to do something bigger? Plant a fruit tree in your backyard. Maybe two. Maybe a raspberry bush. You are now part of saving the human race.

If everyone reading this planted a fruit tree, or even some wild flowers, we could save the bees.

While you are at it, planting a fruit tree has been shown to be one of the best investments on the planet. There's pretty much no investment on the planet that is more financially lucrative (while still being nearly bullet-proof safe) than planting a fruit tree.

You can get a tree at an end of sale auction for literally 5-10 bucks, and that tree will produce THOUSANDS of dollars of fruit for you in it's lifetime. Go spend $200 bucks at an end of season sale, plant 10-20 trees (if you have room), and that $200 will be worth tens of thousands of dollars of saved money.

Do it right, [set it up right and it's almost no work](https://youtu.be/bjBLVSo0zeY) because you offload the work to nature - as it has done for the last few billion years. Go learn how, let me show you how. If you do it right, it's zero work after you have planted and wood-chipped, and all you do is pull dollars off a tree.

_______________________________________________________

Original post starts below. I apologize for the shilling of Permaculture, but I think loss of topsoil will impact us all if we don't reverse it soon. We need soil, we need bees, we need food. We need to stop buying December Bananas in Canada. We need to start supporting local permaculture sustainable farms. We need to do this or we may not make it, and our grandkids stand no chance.

**I also expended the ""now what happens"" section, to explain how these pullbacks are a good thing, make crypto more stable, and why we keep seeing larger ceilings after every pullback... this stuff is really important for you to make money on this thing, if that's your goal....**

I've made a similar post in a few spots, and this is something that is absolutely critical for people to understand... what impacts price, and what is going on lately. Price has only a very minor correlation with money invested, and a major correlation with opinion. 

... and Humans are an emotional bunch.

So what drives price of any commodity, crypto, gold, pizzas, whatever? The money invested in it, right? Kind of, but not really. What if I told you that you could theoretically raise bitcoin from $15k to $20k by spending $1, and lower it from $25k to $1k by spending the same $1? Crazy right?

This is going to start out slow, I want to make sure I get everyone on the same page before I pick things up and lift the curtain. Stick with me here....

This is an example to help illustrate why prices aren't driven by money invested, but rather consensus and opinion. Lets imagine the following exists (we will use bitcoin as an example, but this is how everything on the planet works)

Lets say Bitcoin is currently priced at $10k (the last sale). From $11k to $99k, every $1k there is someone with a sell order of 1 full bitcoin. From $9k to $1 dollar, every $1k on the way down there is someone with a buy order of 1 full bitcoin.

So, right now if you wanted to buy bitcoin you have several options... meet the lowest seller's price of $11k, or, put your own buy order up, above the highest buyer's bid order (overcut them). If you decide to just place an order, the price doesn't change. If you decide the buy the $11k bitcoin, now bitcoins value is $11k, with a new lowest sell offer of $12k, and a highest buy bid of $10k. Someone else comes in an overcuts the buy bid and puts 1 BTC for sale for $11k. No trades are made until someone matches a buy/sell.

Okay, that's kindergarten stuff, most people here understand that. So how much money drove the price up in this situation? $11k, and BTC price raised 11/10, 1.10, or 10% from the last sale. Now the entire marketcap of BTC raised 10% (last sale multiplied by circulating supply). So it takes $11k to drive a 10% increase, right? Not at all. Lets look at what happens when news is released.

News comes out that Warren Buffet thinks bitcoin is a scam, a bubble, and he wouldn't touch it with a 10 foot pole because he only invests in things he understands and he doesn't understand crypto. People panic everywhere, and believe ""this guy is smart, I'm overvaluing this thing"".

Suddenly people don't want to buy this scam anymore, and the buy orders for $11k, $10, and $9k are taken down. 

At the same time, the people wanting to sell start to panic and just want out. The guy at $32k (who just had that offer up ""just incase it moons"") drops down to $11k sell order. The guy at $12k, who was the lowest, now undercuts him to $10k. 

The other buyers see the sellers undercutting and think that if these people want out, why am I buying in. The $8k guy pulls his offer, and so do the $7k, $6k and $5k guys. The highest offer is now $4k. 

The sellers panic further and the $14k guy undercuts the $10k guy and puts up a $9k sell. The $15k, 17k and 11k guys all see this flurry of panic and now a storm undercutting is triggered, to $8k, $7k, and $6k. The $8k order pulls his again and goes down to $5k. 

The price on the buy and sell orders has moved around a ton, but no sales have actually happened yet. Technically, BTC is still ""worth"" $11k, and the market cap reflects that. All this horseshit has happened, and it only happened in 10 seconds, but the price hasn't moved yet. 

The $27k guy wakes up and checks his phone. He had a $27k offer just incase the price moved also, and he also only has a tiny infinitesimal fraction of a BTC. Well, he decides ""he's out"" and fills $1 worth of the part of the $4k guys buy offer.

The latest price information is now updated, and BTC fell from $11k to $4k price per BTC with the movement of a single dollar.

This is exaggerated example, but this is what moves price. Not money in vs money out. The ONLY THING that moves price is perception.

**OPINION FLOW AND NOT MONEY FLOW**

Now the above example only happens if everyone simultaneously believe the same thing... this the asset they are holding is a steaming turd. What happens in reality is there's no black and white, it's shades of gray. It's flow in vs flow out. But again, not flow MONEY, but rather OPINIONS.

If 66% of the holders of something all of a sudden unanimously decide that their asset is overvalued, then they panic sell. Even if 33% of the people decide they are going to buy up as much as these panic sellers sell, if the panic is strong enough, and they are slitting eachother's throat to sell, then the buyers just happily sit and let them do that, and time their buys in. Very little money has to actually change hands in order for this price to crash, all that matters is the FLOW OF OPINION has to be swift and violent, and in majority. The sellers will leapfrog eachother on the way down, faster than the buyers scoop up their sales, and the net result is a crashed price.

Note, this happens both ways... fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) as well as overhyped FOMO (Fear of missing out). 

**So now what happens?**

Time goes by and all holders opinions of their asset hasn't changed. They still think it's worth $11k and they got great deals scooping up what these sellers were selling. The weak hands have left the market and have been replaced with holders. Overall, now a higher percentage of holders believe in the product they are holding and are unwilling to sell for the panic prices of the last week. Panic sellers were also replaced by new money, people who have wanted in for a while and are now in on their perceived ground floor.

Also, people who bought BTC at $1 ten years ago and have been looking for an exit to cash profits have now been replaced by either long term holders, or by these new people who are thrilled to have finally entered, and they are looking to hold long. 

So what happens on pullbacks? The number of people waiting to jump off the ship has decreased. The new ground floor is established. Are we done? Who knows, this could go on for another year, but what matters is that people who want off are getting off and people that want on are getting on. 

People who have panic sold and never believed in this in the firstplace... people who have wanted out for 10 years... they have been replaced by people who are now getting in on THEIR GROUND FLOOR, and are going to be holding long. The market is suddenly increasingly more stable today than it was yesterday, even though prices are down. 

**This is a good thing.** This is why crypto keeps bouncing back from pullbacks and reaches new higher ceilings and floors each time. Old money who wanted out, and new panic holders, they are gone. They are replaced with adopters, holders, believers in this technology. These people aren't selling anytime soon, because they believe that this thing is going to revolutionize the world. Every crash brings more of these people in, and removes more panic sellers out. 

**Moving forward**

Now news releases start coming out about how stock ETFs are being created, NASDAQ index funds, bank support, government support. Companies are using this tech, and companies who use blockchain for transportation are putting non-blockchain companies out of business. 

The people on the outside looking-in feel they are missing out. They now start coming in and buying. They start overpricing eachother on their buy orders, and eventually it gets close enough to a sell order that someone decides they are just going to meet the sell price. The sale goes through.

Sellers (HODLERs) see this action, and they start pulling sell orders off the table almost as fast as they fill. Sure some trades go through, and incoming money is driving the price up as market orders are filled. But what's also happening is people are seeing this flurry of volume, and sellers are pulling sell orders and placing them higher. 

Junk coins and pump and dump scam coins are dying by the millions. In their ashes, good solid technology projects whose coins have fundamental economic reasons for growth, these are rising. Corporate partnerships continue forming. The real world continues to create actual use cases. Companies start storing more and more corporate information on blockchain. Public companies use blockchain to store scientific research (See Canadian Research Council announcements), and blockchain acts as a Library of Alexandria. People can travel out of country without any monetary exchange, using their chosen cryptocurrency to buy the things they need abroad. The world is slowly actually USING this technology. 

Money is coming in, but more importantly, OPINION IS CHANGING. Literally nothing could have happened in terms of fundamentals, partnerships, etc... this can all be driven entirely emotional, so long as it's wide-spread and strong. Infact, the market could THEORETICALLY rebound in this way from $4000/BTC to $1 MILLION PER BITCOIN by the sale of ONE PENNY. $4000 sound low? Does that number make you uncomfortable? We may go that low. We may not. If we do, I'm not panicking and selling, I'm buying more.


**SO WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN THE LAST FEW MONTHS? and where are we going?**

A lot of new money has come in from Nov-Jan, and they don't really know what they are investing in. Sure some of them have done great research and are smart investors but most people aren't and isntead they are buying Symbols and Names and trading on speculation. They are treating their favorite coins like a sports team, and will follow them irrationally off a cliff.

These new people came in and invested in cryptocurrency because their OPINION was heavily influenced in Nov, Dec, Jan, from media. They saw this money making machine called crypto. They were willing to pay huge, ride the wave up, keep buying, etc. They were ""ground floor adopters"" and were going to get rich.

They outnumber the old money by A LOT. Their OPINION MATTERS. It matters the most.

To keep this in perspective, they are also a VAST MINORITY of ""new money"" that will enter the game in the next decade. This cycle will continue over and over and over. 

Their opinion rose nearly unbounded and price rose accordingly. Market cap rose from 10B to 750B, and it could have been VERY LITTLE actual money that did this. How much did it need to be though? Literally ONE PENNY, theoretically. All that matters in moving price is MOMENTUM OF OPINION. I believe it has been estimated that as low as 6B USD was responsible for the bull rush.

These people then started hearing ""Bubble"", ""Scam"", Fake news about governments banning. They don't understand how technology wins, always. Crypto is beyond government control. If they could have stopped Bitcoin they would have done it already. 

**WHO IS DRIVING ALL THIS?**

Most investment opportunities go first to ""accredited investors"". You need to have multimillions in order to get in on the ground floor for most stock IPOs, and we're seeing that start to happen with coin ICOs. Bitcoin was a joke for the first few years, while lunatics picked it up. At this point, it was really too late to get in ""early"", and who would have wanted to anyways, it was all still a joke. So Wallstreet, banks, governments have generally watched on the sidelines as average Joes who were crazy enough to be early adopters and toss $100 on fake internet money slowly became millionaires. 

Not only that, but the idea of blockchain started to become understood. The power and value in it became understood. Not only as a way to track ""monetary value"" but for many other applications as well. Platforms were created, business uses brainstormed, products started being made. This thing started taking off, and wasn't a joke anymore. But regardless, big money wasn't in on the ground floor. They have stakeholders opinions to think of, and what do they say to investors when they lose all their money on magic internet points?

But they have woken up now. This thing has ""popped"" many times now and keeps recovering. This thing won't die. could they have been wrong all along? If they want in, how do they get in? They are no dummies, they have been controlling the world their whole lives? Look at the media experiment that Trump is doing? He is testing just how we work... you can do literally anything and we remember it for like 30 seconds, until the next news story comes out. We change opinions very easily. We are swayed very easily. We are their puppets. Media controls the world. They know their way in.

They have ONE WEAPON against cryptocurrency.

YOUR OPINION OF IT.

And they know it.

**Media.**

That's why FUD is so powerful and needs to be respected. It's why we need to read more than titles on news articles. We need to question what we read, **whether it's good news or bad news**. We need to think about ""what are the motives of the person saying this to me"". Does the government have a conflict of interest when they state that crypto is gambling? Do they have skin in the game? 

What about wall street? Does WEISS ratings possibly have incentive to come out with poor ratings? Do banks have incentive to lock accounts in order to ""protect"" customers from ""unsafe investments"" when their entire business model revolves around holding as much of your money as possible and making money off it? Do you think banks have any super secret hidden interest in preventing you from storing your money elsewhere? I'm not sure, maybe you can critically think about that.

Just understand that this goes both ways. When crypto is booming and Fox news is showing people how to buy $4 ripple on prime time, you may want to start putting in some stop loss orders. When the suicide hotline is stickied at the top of /r/cryptocurrency and everyone is panic selling, you may want to start picking up some firesale deals. 

So, the question is this... Is crypto undervalued or overvalued at it's price today? Where is the price going long term? **I'm not talking about it's use case**, I'm talking about in the **court of public opinion**, where is THAT going? Because THAT is what is going to drive price in the future.

Without a crystal ball, this is of course impossible to know. Do your own research and form your own opinion. It could very well be that the technology having a use-case will in and of itself drive opinion, and thus price. But make sure you understand that it's not the technology itself, it's not the value of the business itself, it's not the use case itself that will drive price, it is the publics OPINION of that thing which drives price. They are intertwined, but they are NOT the same thing.

TLDR: VERY VERY little money has to move around in order to swing prices drastically, up or down. Money in and out doesn't drive price, OPINION does. How do you let the news you read impact your opinion?How are you being played (on both sides, shilling and FUD).

Something is only worth what people think it's worth. Often that's based on reality, value, business, money, but often it's entirely emotional.

[Structure your portfolio in a balance, intelligent way, using risk methodology.](https://www.investinblockchain.com/cryptocurrency-investment-risk-management/). Invest money you are willing to lose. Support legitimate technology and teams who are actively driving their product to completion, coding, and marketing. Stop trying to make money overnight in pump and dump scams, or pyramid schemes. 

Every day, take one coin, do a deep dive on it, learn it inside and out. Look into their team and their past. Do that every day for a year, and you just learned 365 coins inside and out. Ask yourself the following key questions:

Have those members consistently jumped ship on previous projects? Is that where you want to invest in? Is their team capable of executing on their vision? Are they trying to solve world hunger, and their team is a few 16 year olds in a garage? How active is their github? Are they adding chunks of code regularly, or is a ghost town? Are they marketing their product at all? Or is marketing the only thing they are doing? 

What are the economics of their coin itself? Is it required to be used to gain access to their technology? Are there burns? How premined is it, and what portion do the founders hold? 

What about their vision? Are they trying to solve a problem that needs to be solved? What are the economics of that problem and how much money does the solution potentially save clients?

These are all questions you should be asking when you give your money to someone else. We're a lot more stable than we were - a correction was bound to happen. Too much early money wanted to cash in profits. These people have been replaced by new money who is holding on their own ground floor. The whole industry in general is still in very early stages. Rest assured that anyone reading this is still very much an early adopter. Just make sure you are investing in actual technology, and supporting capable teams, and not buying air. Buy the Googles and Amazons of Crypto, not the pets.com or flooz.com of cryptos.

Happy investing everyone.

Now how many of you are *depending* on crypto to get you out of your dire situation because you literally have no other options? 

I know from being on this sub a long time a lot of us are doing this because we are banking on crypto to get us out of the gutter and achieve a level of financial freedom our broken economic systems could never help us achieve. 99% of the posts you see here aren't of people hoping to become millions despite all our joking about moons and Lambos. The majority of ""cashing out"" posts you see are for modest, reasonable goals. Going to college, taking care of elderly parents, getting by in poor countries, owning a house. These are all things that in our age of technological advancement and productivity should be considered bare essentials and yet here we are betting it all on magic meme money to save us and give us the minimum we hoped for out of life.

Musk, Bezos, Zuckerberg, and the rest of them are literal symbols of the broken systems that have led us here and necessitated the creation of crypto to allow us to claw back a tiny bit of agency in this crazy world. Their bloated assets, larger than many countries' GDP, give them the kind of power 1000 ancient kings couldn't even dream of. They aren't on our side. If there was the mere hint that crypto could threaten their status or wealth you bet your ass they would turn on us in a second.

What they are and how you can avoid them.""* Since then I got a lot of messages from people asking me how they can tell the difference between a new coin with lots of potential and a shitcoin. For maximum protection, make sure you follow this guide in combination with the other guide. I will not repeat those rules here. If you don't follow the rules of the other guide as well, you will lose your money.

Before I start, some background: I trade small coins for a living. In the beginning, while learning, I fell for all the scams just like everyone else. But with every loss I learned something new and I'm now pretty good at it. Yes, I have losses like everyone else, but usually I get out with very small losses compared to my gains.

Anyone here hating shitcoins, I agree with you. **I hate shitcoins too.** Part of what I want to explain here however is that not every new coin is a shitcoin. Every coin has to start with 0 holders. Everyone has to start somewhere. And every solid project deserves a chance to grow. Yes, the vast majority of new coins are shitcoins, but I want to help you tell the difference between the real gems and all the shitcoins.

# The Golden Rules

If you start looking for the real gems and want to trade smaller coins, **follow these rules or you will lose money**. 

1. Start trading on the BSC (Binance) Smart Chain. Why? Transactions cost around $0.20 max. You can't do this on the ETH chain where you spend lots on gas fees, sorry. I know they came down, but they're still too high.
2. For the first 1-2 months, don't invest more than $5 per coin. I am not joking. Yes, your gains will not be thousands of dollars, but if you go in with more you will end up losing a lot of money, trust me.
3. Have a small bag of maybe $150 or $200. Be prepared to lose your small bag completely. If you can't afford this and sleep well at night, don't do it.

**Ready? Let's start:**

# Find the Coins

Go to the BscScan website (look up the links yourself, I don't want to link-spam this post). Then, go to ""View BEP-20 Transfers"". If the list looks confusing, don't worry. Look at the rightmost column that says ""Tokens"". You must look for the grey icon besides the coin names. Why? Because that means the coin is new. Established coins already have their icons listed and that means you're usually too late to make high gains. You can refresh that page for new coins every second, you will always find new ones.

Open the new coins (with the grey icon) in separate tabs and look at them. So, now you have found a coin, it's time to investigate.

# 1. Holders

On the page you just opened, look at the ""Holders"" list. The biggest holders of a coin should always be the liquidity pool which is usually identified as ""PancakeSwap: COIN NAME"" and the dead coins wallet, usually identified as ""0x000000000000000000000000000000000000dead"". Why is this important? It reduces the possibility of a rugpull to almost zero, especially if the dead coins wallet is over 50%.

Also watch out if there are too many whales. For example, 10 wallets each holding 3% of total coins is a huge red flag. Abort immediately. A healthy new coin should also have at least 200-300 holders. If it doesn't, also abort immediately.

# 2. Liquidity Pool

The liquidity pool is super important. I usually don't buy any new coin unless the liquidity pool is at least $30k or more. Why? Because scammers and shitcoins rarely provide a liquidity pool of that size. Again, we're greatly reducing our risks here. A locked liquidity pool is also important. Make sure it's locked for a longer period of time. 3 months, 6 months, 1 year or longer are great. You don't want the liquidity pool to unlock tomorrow. You can copy the contract ID and then go to ""PooCoin"" (again, look up the links yourself), then enter the contract URL there, hit enter and on the next page on the left side it will show you something like ""COIN/BNB LP BNB Holdings:"". That's where you want at least $30k or more. If it has a few hundred dollars or even only $5k or $7k, abort immediately.

# 3. Volume

Look at the ""Transfers"" section. If the coin has only 5 holders and no activity, skip it. If you want, bookmark it and come back to check tomorrow. You may have just been too early. If it has only a few transactions every 2-3 hours, also abort immediately. It's not taking off yet. A good number of transactions for a new coin should be about 5-10 per minute.

# 4. Website & Twitter

Make sure the coin has a website and twitter account. If it doesn't have both of them, abort immediately. If it also has a reddit page, a Telegram channel, a Discord, an Instagram page, a YouTube channel, etc. that's even better.

# 5. Coin Name & Design

The logo of the coin and the design of the graphics and website are very important. If it's not attractive, people will not jump in and it won't take off. If the use stock images that you've seen a hundred times elsewhere, abort immediately. The name is also super important. If it has a catchy name like ""Save The World"" it's much more likely to take off than ""Funky Toilet Coin 55"".

# 6. Bonus: Doxxed Team

This one is a HUGE bonus. If the team members publicly identify themselves, for example through YouTube videos or live AMA, it reduces the chance of a scam to almost zero. Why? Because their faces and identities are publicly known and they would almost certainly end up in prison.

# That's it!

Did the coin you investigated fail in any of the first 5 steps? I cannot stress this enough, but: ABORT IMMEDIATELY. Don't invest in it. You will end up losing your money.

Did the coin pass all of the above steps? Great! You ***might*** have found a gem. Do some more research before you jump in and make sure the coin has a real purpose. Remember, things like hodling to get more coins or ""to the moon!"" are not real purposes.

And now we go back to the golden rules. If you are ready to invest in this coin, **remember to only invest $5 for the first 1-2 months** of doing this. I cannot stress this enough. You are learning and you will make mistakes. Make sure you are okay with losing that money because even if a coin matches all of the above, it can still fail for a variety of reasons. If you stick to this rule, you can still make a good amount of money in these 1-2 months. I easily made $10 to $50 with just $5. Sometimes I got out at $3.50 because a coin didn't take off and re-invested elsewhere.

Once you've done the above for 1-2 months and you've noticed any potential mistakes you made, you should be ready to start trading with $10 or $20 per coin (depending on your financial situation).

Two more important things to remember:

1. Early coins take time to take off. It's very possible that your $5 investment will drop to $3 or $2 in that time and go up to $10 and then go back down to $4. It may just sit there doing nothing for 5-14 days. That's absolutely normal.
2. Keep track of what the team is doing during this time. If there are no updates for 2-3 days, sell and get out. A good team should update its holders several times per day through several channels (Twitter, Discord, Telegram, etc). It's okay to get only 1 update per day, but less than that is a red flag.

I **always** follow the above rules when trading with small coins and I currently have success with 90-95% of coins that I invest in. Trust me, **I tried to skip some of the rules above and I got burned every time**. Yes, it's a lot of work. Especially if you have to repeat these steps for every single coin you want to investigate, but you will get much faster at it over time. If you end up doing this for a living, you will probably be able to investigate 2-3 coins per minute.

Now, if you excuse me, I need a coffee and relax my fingers a bit. They hurt :P"

I now see my mistake. But more importantly, I see why I learned from it. If I had put a smaller sum down, I would have learned the exact same lesson, but still had money to put in while the market moves sideways.

My takeaway from this is that you should definitely DCA slowly if your a first year crypto investor. Trust this advice from somebody who bought at the top.

> In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. **As part of the policy, which was duly approved by the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors, we may invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets**, gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds and other assets as specified in the future. Thereafter, we invested an aggregate $1.50 billion in bitcoin under this policy and may acquire and hold digital assets from time to time or long-term. Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt. **We believe our bitcoin holdings are highly liquid. However, digital assets may be subject to volatile market prices, which may be unfavorable at the time when we want or need to liquidate them.**

Pornhub just saved a lot of my crypto,18655,nwogjt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nwogjt/pornhub_just_saved_a_lot_of_my_crypto/,ObscureOP,1623333899.0,False,PRIVACY,t3_nwogjt,False,1855,False,0.9,"So about 20 minutes ago, I got a ""hey, did you fly to Germany overnight?"" Unauthorized login email from pornhub. Checked it, sure enough someone logged in with my password. Don't give two shits about someone watching porn on my account, so I immediately went to work on the rest.

I don't share passwords with any accounts, but pornhub one was an oddly secure password that probably couldn't be brute forced... I assumed breach.

Changed all my exchange passwords that were tied to the same email, and switched all their 2fa to my phone instead of email. That's when I start getting login failure notices... Of course they hit the exchanges first.

After that I damage controlled financial institution accounts, and sure enough started seeing login failures on those. About 15 minutes after I got the pornhub notice (when serious damage would've already been done) I got a ""possible breach"" notification from capital one assistant.

I totally am usually asleep right now. Pornhub may have just saved me tens of thousands of dollars, and is apparently more reliable than all my financial institutions.

****Update and FAQ:

Thanks so much for the awards and responses! I just thought this was a funny near miss and wanted to share my maniacal laughter, had no idea it would blow up like this.

So, turns out it was my phone that was malware compromised. Factory reset, extended authy to everything for now, all passwords changed, all financial institutions alerted.

As has been pointed out a few times in comments, it's likely they accessed pornhub first because if I had linked crypto wallets or bank accounts for tipping, they could just send all meh money to their verified account. Probably a super easy front door way of scooping a couple BTC up from unwitting peoples... Hadn't thought of that, I just assumed they were testing access.

No, having a pornhub account doesn't mean I pay for porn, just that I like to save playlists and favorites. Some of you are living in the 90s of internet porn. 

Amazed at how many people assume that the breach came from pornhub. Frankly, it seems like they guard info better than anyone else I deal with. I would never think of putting personal information into any porn site... Pornhub's app has always proven to be secure and well supported.

All credit accounts frozen, all financial institutions contacted. Net loss of ZERO. They attempted a $7000 wire transfer out of my checking account that my small town bank ofc called me about, and a $1300 credit card purchase that got declined as sketch. Otherwise it seems I beat them to all accounts.

****EDIT 2:

Since so many people are asking about my phone... It's an Android, brand new Motorola sealed in box. No, I don't know the source, just know that it happened in a 2 hour window before I got all my security up and running, during which time I used it for work a lot and downloaded a lot of my standard programs.

I just ran my basic security check, and thing came up red af, so I didn't even bother trying to treat... I only have had it for a week, reset was easy."

We wondered what it would be like. We have been asking ourselves that question since 2016 and possibly even earlier. Well...

Here is your answer. This is how the market looks like when we start to see a tiny bit of mass adoption.

Billionaires are manipulating the market? It's a part of the mass adoption game we have to accept. There are ways to resist it, but you can't just say ""Please Elton go home and shut up"" because guess what, Elton won't go home and shut up. 

You can't ban anyone from coming into this space, that's the whole point of fucking decentralization. You can't ban a billionaire from participating in the same way you can't ban a school teacher from participating.

You want to complain about people buying doggy coins? Same shit. Tough luck that your coin is only seeing 1000% growth and not 10,000% boo. Again, you can resist your FOMO and you can invest smartly into fundamentals, but you cannot ban people from spending their money. It's their money and you're not HSBC. No matter how much you wish for it, you can't ban people from buying Bitconnect or Cumdoggy coins or whatever, they'll learn from their experience and that's how the market will correct it self.

Rejoice crypto hodlers. 

The days we have been dreaming about have arrived.

On the Night of May 15th, a Twitter profile tweeted Doge Coin is the chosen one by Elon Musk because of its lower fees and less environmental effect.

Elon Musk replies that he wants to speed up Block time 10X and increase Block size 10X to reduce transaction fee 100X, for Doge Coin. 

If the solution of blockchain scaling was simply to change the variables, why Adam Beck didn't think of this and why Satoshi didn't think of this.

Even now projects like Ethereum can increase the limit and make transaction fees on the chain reduce over 1000X.

THE SOLUTION IS NOT TO JUST CHANGE NUMBERS.

It seriously has a bad effects on the network security and decentralization. (Please remember this)

Many projects like BCH and BSV has tried all this. And failed.

This narrative is so 2013.

Bitcoin has proven itself again and again over the years on why it is the King. And projects like Ethereum are working for years to scale in this perspective. 

If you are new to crypto, please do not get manipulated by Elon Musk's tweets. 

IMO, Doge Coin is just a tool for Elon to flex his dominance around this space. It won't last long as he clearly has no clue what he is talking about."

"I've retired thanks to crypto, but there's something very few people think about or tell you: boredom hits hard",16397,lz4x37,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lz4x37/ive_retired_thanks_to_crypto_but_theres_something/,reddito321,1615047457.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_lz4x37,False,1993,False,0.82,"TL;DR: do not stop working/studying when/if you get rich through crypto (or by any other means). Set up your own business, study something you love or whatever. Just make sure your brain will keep doing some exercise and that you'll be part of some group/society.

Seeing so many posts about when lambo, when moon etc., I see myself a few years ago discovering that I could finally hasten by \~10 years my retirement (I'm in my 60's now). Damn, was I happy about that. I could finally erase all my debt, travel without worrying about days off being discounted of my paycheck, spend lots of time with my family and buy some of the stuff I've always wanted. In \~6 months my life changed really hard, and for the better! I gave my grand kids a nice trip do Disney and paid the wedding of my youngest daughter. Suddenly everything fit perfectly.

After 7-8 months, then, I got myself thinking like ""so... is this it?"". I was not happy anymore. Don't get me wrong: I wasn't *unhappy*, but I wasn't happy either. I would wake up everyday, go for a walk, pass by some bakery and buy some stuff, and get back home to surf on the web. I could of course travel to wherever I wanted, but what for? 

Friends came in asking for money and I never heard from them again. Some relatives thought I'd won the lottery and suddenly became extremely friendly and helpful, even though literally no one but my daughter and her husband were here at my wife's funeral. 

At the end, I've decided to go back to studying and finally entered college. It changed my way of perceiving the world and now I'm quite happy. I've also volunteered at some NGOs in my city and it helped me to keep my pace with society.

So my advice is that you need to get prepared to deal with boredom. We grow up with our parents telling us to go to school, have a job, a car, a house and that this is life. But when you suddenly have the car, the house and everything else, what's left? Do something for yourself and have this in mind. 

Boredom hits hard and you need to get prepared to deal with it.

Godspeed to you all!

EDIT: wow, never expected so many reactions to this post! Thanks for the love you all! Will try to reply to some comments soon.

EDIT2: My DM box is flooded with people asking for advice. I did NOT day trade, I simply held whatever I had. I was lucky to be at the right place and time to acquire cheap coins that happened to moon in 2017.

EDIT3: People in the comments saying it’s my fault for not thinking about other aspects of life before having money. You can’t be much of a philosopher without having had the time or money to study. I had to work to eat and lived from paycheck to paycheck for a fair amount of time. All my worries were immediate."

John claimed he was too 'busy' to invest, i.e. playing video games all day and jacking off in his uni dorm room.

However, recently, John had a change of heart. he wanted to pull himself together and thought that crypto would be the catalyst so he came to me to learn. naturally i was ecstatic, this was one of my best friends and i really enjoy teaching people things. I taught John everything i knew, how to use exchanges, how to set up a wallet, how to spot good projects, the trends of the market etc.. i spent countless hours of my personal time helping him learn basic things (he is a bit slow).

Now, i warned John to steer clear of shitcoins. i told him that although you may get lucky and get rich quick, the chance of this happening is so low and newbies like him fall victim to these scams the most. he was very off put by this and assured me he would avoid them.

A few weeks go buy and i received a very long message from John. He told me he was quitting crypto and he had lost all of his savings he put in. i was shocked, but as i read the message it became clear to me what had happened. he said a youtuber had basically shilled him a 'low market cap' coin telling him he could 50x his money in a week. Yes, John fell victim to a pump and dump.

This is where it gets worse, i replied asking why would he do this when i advised him otherwise. i got no message back, i called him a few days after and to my shock the phone would instantly hang up. John blocked me on everything, not just phone but instagram, whatsapp, facebook. i was shocked and upset, i had done nothing wrong. i asked one of our mutual friends if i could speak to John, and he told me that John wanted nothing to do with me because i had made him lose all his money,

He didnt blame himself, or even the scammy youtuber, he blamed the person who introduced him to crypto and **warned** him of scams.

It really hurts writing this knowing ive lost someone i knew for 10 years over something i didn't even do. i just tried to help.

The moral of the story is don't advise people to get into crypto, or tell them what to invest in, friends or even family, because when shit goes south the first person they will blame is you.

edit: thanks for all the advice and support guys, ive changed my mind and im no longer sad about this. its better to get rid of people like this now than in the future."

They even have an option for ""health check for work permit"" which is significantly cheaper than a real check-up. The doctor takes your blood and shakes it around for 2 minutes and then signs a piece of paper.

Anyway, I decided to go get a real check-up from an actual HIV/STD clinic because, for some reason, I actually want to know if I'm carrying a deadly virus.

Anyway, I pay with the card from my bank. This was a few weeks ago. My bank knows where I work and they know I'm a teacher. I'm not sure why someone was looking at my transactions, or maybe this kind of transaction gets flagged automatically for different professions. Anyway, the school asked me about the results from my test and if I could send them a copy, just to make sure of course.

Luckily the results were negative so I don't actually have to hide anything but what the fuck.

This is why we need decentralized currency and hopefully some more private options will become more readily available in the future."
EXPOSED: Tesla lost its carbon credits market in Europe so it's trying to create a renewable credits market by attacking Bitcoin mining,15418,ojywf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ojywf1/exposed_tesla_lost_its_carbon_credits_market_in/,xcryptogurux,1626245943.0,True,POLITICS,t3_ojywf1,False,1316,False,0.86,"I'm going to try to explain Elon Musk's seemingly ""big brain"" but actually pretty dumb gambit with regards to Bitcoin mining. Note carefully the dates on each development in the story.

Why did Tesla buy $1.5 billion worth of Bitcoin?

Couple of factors - one short-term and one long-term.

**Short-term play** \- Tesla's production was halted due to supply chain effects from the pandemic. This is why there has been a lot of delivery delays this year. This meant that Tesla's shrinking profits from selling carbon credits to other carmakers alone wasn't enough to post a profitable quarter.

So Tesla decided to buy Bitcoin and then sell some of it (10%) before the end of Q1 2021 to make up for the shortfall. It wasn't to *""test liquidity""* as Musk claimed.

[Bitcoin purchase made sure Tesla had a profitable Q1 2021](https://preview.redd.it/kl5io232k4b71.png?width=1200&format=png&auto=webp&s=fd804647696cb66355c6f86813aebea7c3ffc2a5)

[2020 was Tesla's first-ever net-positive year thanks to carbon credits sales](https://preview.redd.it/bsqm2midk4b71.png?width=1010&format=png&auto=webp&s=143bd79e7eab0c149b3741174b1889990e530ea5)

[But that source of revenue is shrinking \(May 6\)](https://preview.redd.it/nvqwgowhk4b71.png?width=914&format=png&auto=webp&s=a61238f0ecfc9d394c7c0fdd580ba178ba7b224c)

**Long-term play** \- The reason for Tesla's revenue from carbon credits sales shrinking is that European carmakers are shifting focus to EV themselves, meaning they no longer need to purchase credits from Tesla to comply with strict emissions regulations in the EU.

So Tesla now needs to make up for this potentially permanent revenue loss. What do they do?

**One day before Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin payments** *""due to* *rapidly increasing use of fossil fuels for Bitcoin mining and transactions""***, Tesla applied for renewable credits certificate from the EPA.**

[ Tesla applied for renewable credits, one day before Bitcoin mining FUD \(May 12\)](https://preview.redd.it/cv3iaqtcn4b71.png?width=1025&format=png&auto=webp&s=5965e5ed7a4dbfdf035ec32544bb09851ffe703a)

Unlike carbon credits, which can only be sold to other carmakers, the EPA's renewable credits can be sold in the open market to ANY industry.

Elon figured he could create a new renewable credits market out of Bitcoin miners (buying renewable credits from Tesla) to replace Tesla's revenue loss from selling carbon credits to carmakers.

Too bad for Elon, Bitcoin mining uses 4x higher than the average share of renewables in the US (56%).

The dumbest part of all this has to be the use of *""and transactions""* because no incremental energy is used for transactions. This guy frankly has zero understanding of how Bitcoin works.

Either that or he's being disingenuous to pressure miners into submission and purchase renewable credits from Tesla to offset their emissions. Don't be surprised to find out this was the point of his meeting with the Bitcoin Mining Council (which is nonsense btw).

Personally, I don't think it's in his interest to understand. Notice how he's trying to hijack dog coin and turn it into PayPal.

**Bitcoin does not benefit beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme. Tax-dodging billionaires who get free money from the government making the rest of our money worth less are at the top of the pyramid and they're loving it!** *(credit iTruth84)*

Will DOGE be worth $100 a coin? Can it become as big as ETH? Could Stellar Lumens be worth $1000 a coin? Will Safemoon make me rich?? We all need to look at total supply vs market cap to manage our expectations and be more logical about what is possible.,15367,n5wkwq,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5wkwq/will_doge_be_worth_100_a_coin_can_it_become_as/,lunargrover,1620266460.0,False,STRATEGY,t3_n5wkwq,False,3230,False,0.81,"The answer to all of those lofty expectations? Impossible. This is a mistake a lot of people are making. You have to look at total supply and multiply it by price per coin to get the market cap. Let’s look at a few popular ones…

Bitcoin is rare like gold, difficult to mine like gold and is used as a store of value like gold. As it becomes more scarce, it will continue to rise in price. It has a total supply of 21 million, of which 18 million are already circulating. After the 21 million are mined, there will be no more available. 18 million x $57k means it has a market cap of over a trillion dollars. That is huge. The total market cap for ALL crypto is 2.38 trillion. Bitcoin is king. Bigger than Visa and MasterCard combined. Bigger than nearly every world bank. It is the world’s 3rd largest currency. 

Ethereum has a total supply of 115 million. More coins than Bitcoin. At the moment, it allows for 18 million to be mined each year max. In July, they are making a change with the London Hardfork, EIP 1559, and every time a transaction is made with ETH, the ETH fees will be burned, making the supply more limited and much more valuable, similar to BTC. Many are saying that ETH will go up to $10k per coin this year because of these changes. When ETH 2.0 is released next year, the price will probably go much higher. With 115 million in circulation, ETH has a market cap of $400 billion. That’s worth more than all of Walmart. 

So, it is really important to check the coin supply and then multiply that by the price you wish it would go to to make you rich. See if the amount seems realistic or not. 

Let’s look at DOGE. Doge has a total supply of 127 billion coins and a max of 10,000 are mined each day [EDIT: DOGE mints 10,000
coins every *minute*, not every day!]. That’s an additional 5 billion coins each year. If you multiply 127 billion coins the $100 you wish it were per coin, it would have a market cap of $12.7 trillion dollars. There is $37 trillion dollars in the world. Is DOGE worth 1/3 of all the money in the world? The entire economy of the United States is $25.3 trillion. Is it realistic to say a meme coin is worth roughly half the US economy…the largest economy in the world?

Let’s take a look at Stellar Lumens. The max supply is $50 billion. The supply increase is 500 million a year, which alone is 23 times the total amount of BTC each year. Anyway, if it were $1000 per coin, the total market cap would be $50 trillion, more than double the US economy. At the very most, maybe they could be $10 each? I say it could be worth $10 because it has actual utility. I think DOGE would top out at $1, and that would be pretty crazy. 

If DOGE were worth as much as ETH, which I’ve seen people on the doge subreddit think might happen, Doge would be worth a modest $388,720,000,000,000. $388 trillion. That’s at least 3 times all the money in the world economy, if Google serves me right.

Then you have to be really careful of coins that are just a rug pull and get promoted on Tik-Tok, like Safemoon. I don’t even need to do the math on Safemoon to know it’s a scam. They will get people to throw all their money into it and then they cash out their supply and take everyone’s money. The total supply for Safemoon is 1 quadrillion coins!!! Stay away from that. Insanity. 

Look at supply of successful coins beyond BTC and ETH and see if you think they could be worth a lot more in the future. Here are some I think worth investing in:

Polkadot (DOT): Total supply: 935.5 million, total supply 1 billion

Chainlink (LINK): Total supply: 419 million, max 1 billion

Cardano (ADA): Total supply: 45 billion. This coin has many great uses, but will not be worth as much as others simply because of the number of circulating coins. Maybe $10-$12 a coin max? But it is under $2 right now. 

ATOM: Total supply: 248 million. New coins are created each year as rewards for people that hold (stake) ATOM. If you can find a good coin that gives you APR, many are 5-6%…much better than a traditional savings account! 

Algorand (ALGO): 2.96 billion, also releases new coins as rewards to people that hold ALGO. 

Tezos (XTZ), circulating supply: 756 million. Total supply: 763 million. 

MANA: this coin is only used for a video game called Decentraland. Atari is making a casino opening in May in that virtual world. Supply available: 1.5 billion. Total supply: 2.6 billion. 

Polygon (MATIC): 10 billion, half in circulation. Because there is a max supply of 10 billion, if it grew to the size of ETH…which won’t happen…each coin would be worth $35 a coin (Take the market cap of ETH and divide it by the supply of MATIC to see what it would be if it were as huge as ETH). It’s under a dollar now. Maybe it could grow to 1/4 of ETH if we’re being optimistic? That would put it at $8.75 a coin. 

Enjin (ENJ) 1 billion coins max, 834 million circulating. 

The list goes on, I just picked a handful of random coins I hear mentioned a lot, but all you need to do to check out what a realistic expectation for a coin is is to take the current supply of tokens, multiply it by what you wish the coin was worth and compare the market cap to BTC or ETH’s market cap, over a trillion and $400 billion, respectively. I don’t expect any alt coin to be worth as much as those those two. And, it bears repeating, the entire cryptocurrency market is worth 2.38 trillion. If you calculate that your coin at $100 is going to be worth double, triple, or quadruple that, I’d say that’s an impossibility. Likewise, you can do the math the other way to see what your coin would be worth per coin if it were as big as ETH or BTC by simply dividing the market cap for ETH or BTC by the number of coins circulating for your prospective coin. Your coin won’t grow as big as those two, but it’s a good way to visualize it and manage your expectations. 

(Note that some of my supply numbers might be off a little, but they should be in the general ballpark)"

It is not perfect and you obviously shouldn't make any decision based on this list, but hopefully it will help newcomers find some projects they're interested in and understanding a little bit better this technology.

If something is wrong or misleading, feel free to comment and I'll edit the post. Obviously in 2 sentences is hard to describe the whole project idea, but I tried my best.

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original. According to the creator (or creators?) Satoshi Nakamoto, it was created to allow “online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution.”
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** Ethereum is the wonder child of crypto, acts as an infrastructure for most decentralized applications. Introduces smart contracts, which are like programs with specific procedures that, once deployed, no one can change.
3. **Tether (USDT):** a centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar (so Elon, please don’t try to pump it)
4. **Polkadot (DOT):** open-source protocol aimed at connecting all different blockchains and allowing them to work together, allowing transfers of any data.
5. **Cardano (ADA):** Another blockchain, trying to improve scalability, interoperability and sustainability of cryptocurrencies. Those who hold the cryptocurrency have the right to vote on any proposed changes in the software.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** centralized coin, most people don’t see a future for it after SEC went after it.
7. **Binance Coin (BNB)**: coin associated with the Binance exchange, so valuable since it is the most popular centralized exchange.
8. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin’s cousin, with faster transactions and lower fees.
9. **Chainlink (LINK):** the main idea is to LINK smart contracts with real-world data, verifying that this data is correct.
10. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** Wow, such high ranking! (Okay, now please let’s get Stellar back in the top 10).
11. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** fork of Bitcoin (so a copy with some differences), which tries to lower transaction fees and increase scalability but has been surpassed technology-wise by many other coins aiming to do just the same.
12. **Stellar (XLM):** talking about currencies, XLM is one of the coins aiming to do just that, with fast processing times and low fees. It has also already become a stablecoin! (I’m kidding).
13. **USD Coin (USDC):** another centralized stablecoin tied to the dollar, like USDT.
14. **Aave (AAVE):** take a bank and make it decentralized, where the liquidity comes from the users and they earn fees from borrows. This is Aave.

26. **Terra (LUNA):** aiming to support a global payment network, it tries to create a decentralized stablecoin with an elastic money supply, enabled by stable mining incentives. Its related stablecoin is TerraUSD
27. **Maker (MKR):** MakerDAO is the organization behind DAI, one of the most famous stablecoins. MKR is a token that allows you to receive dividends and vote in governing the system.
28. **Synthetix (SNX):** protocol on the ethereum blockchain aiming to allow trading of derivatives (shorting or going long on a certain asset).
29. **Avalanche (AVAX):** open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange, where anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. It claims to be lightweight, with high throughput and scalable.
30. **VeChain (VET):** a blockchain focusing on business use-cases more than on technology, bringing this technology to the masses without them even knowing they’re using it.
31. **Compound (COMP):** It’s the Bitcoin of DeFi. It was the first-mover and without him many other projects wouldn’t be around today.
32. **IOTA (MIOTA):** open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things, with zero transaction fees and high scalability since it uses a blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same (it may sound wrong but it’s actually a genius concept, impossible to sum up in a single sentence).
33. **Neo (NEO):** Blockchain application platform and cryptocurrency for digitized identities and assets, aiming to create a smart economy. It was one of the coins that suffered most after the 2018 bull run.

48. **Decred (DCR):** it is a blockchain-based cryptocurrency aimed at facilitating open governance and community interaction. It achieves this by avoiding monopoly over voting status in the project itself, giving to all DCR holders the same amount of decision-making power.
49. **The Graph (GRT):** Trying to become the decentralized Google, it is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum. It allows everyone to publish open APIs that applications can query to retrieve blockchain data.
50. **yearn.finance (YFI):** part of the DeFi ecosystem, it is an aggregator that tries to simplify the DeFi space for investors, automatic the process of maximizing the profits from yield farming.

&#x200B;

\*EDIT:

A couple of coin descriptions were just jokes, here are the actual explanations:

* **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** It is a fork of Bitcoin Cash (which is also a fork of Bitcoin). Once again, the reason behind this is to ""stay true to Satoshi vision"", trying to improve scalability and stability.
* **Monero (XMR):** Monero's goal is simple: to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, it’s often easy to trace payments back to their original source because blockchains are transparent. On the other hand, XMR is designed to obscure senders and recipients alike through the use of advanced cryptography. Obviously this made this coin the go-to on the dark web."

We've seen a peak bubble at around 850 billion total market cap in the first week of January, consolidated down to $750 billion and have now just experienced a 40% correction. 

#What's happening now and how bad will it get?
----------------------------------------------------------------------

First of all you should realize that there is a [January Dip that happens every year, when we see a roughly 20-30% decline around mid January](https://i.imgur.com/VXEHw0W.png). This year its been much more severe though for several additional factors that have compounded on top.

Different theories exist on why this happens (its actually the mirror opposite of the ""January Effect"" that happens in the US stock market), but the two major theories are:

1) Asian markets pull into fiat because of Asian New Year spending needs

2) People in the US sell in January to defer their capital gains tax liability an extra year

While this cyclic event has lead to a healthy correction in the last few years, this year we got these new factors making more fear as well:

* [Yet more scary news on China cracking down on crypto exchanges](http://www.coindesk.com/pboc-official-calls-for-wider-ban-on-chinese-crypto-trading-report/)

* [Korea regulatory uncertainty](http://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-01-16/cryptocurrencies-resume-slide-as-bitcoin-tumbles-to-december-low)

* [European governments talking about regulations](http://news.yahoo.com/rule-bitcoin-must-global-germanys-central-bank-says-154144224--business.html)

* [BTC futures contracts are now expiring this week](http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/equity-index/us-index/bitcoin_quotes_settlements_futures.html), and possible manipulation there with contract hedging pushing the price down

* Bitconnect Ponzi finally collapses

* We had a new breed of speculators come in during the November/December timeframe after media made cryptocurrency mainstream following the Bitcoin 10K landmark. While cryptocurrency markets have always had too much hype, the latest rise wasn't just over-enthusiasm in fundamentally sound cryptocurrencies like Monero and Ethereum, but mass inflows of fiat into vaporware and complete nonsense without any use case. Many people came in to essentially gamble on symbols on an exchange, and are thus short term oriented and quick to sell on any slight downturn, which such further adds to selling pressure.

So in essence we got a storm of scary news along with the usual cyclic downturn. Currently I don't see this as being a systematic crash like Mt.Gox was that would lead to a long term bear market because the fundamental ecosystem is still intact, and I suspect that after about a month we should consolidate around a new low. All the exchanges are still operational and liquid, and there is no breakdown in trust nor uncertainty whether you'll be able to cash out. What range the market trades in will all depend how Bitcoin does, right now we've already broken below 10K but I'm seeing a lot of support at around $8000, which is [roughly where the long term MA curve settles](https://i.imgur.com/kKVsoUt.png). We don't know how bad it will get or what the future will bring, but as of right now we shouldn't be in a bear market yet.

**What should you do if you recently entered the market?**

If you did buy in the last few months at or near ATH, the very worst thing you can do now is sell in panic and lose your principal. You shouldn't have more money in crypto than you can afford to lose, so it shouldn't be a problem to wait. You have to realize that 30% corrections in crypto are relatively common, just last fall we had a 40% flash correction over more China fears. Unless there is a systematic breakdown like we had during Mt.Gox, the market always recovers. 

The other worst thing you can do is unload into Tether as your safety net. If there is one thing that could actually cause a long term destruction of trust within the cryptocurrency investment ecosystem, its Tether having a run up on their liabilities and not having enough reserve to cover the leverage. It would not only bring down exchanges but lead to years of litigation and endless media headlines that will scare off everybody from putting fiat in. I don't know when the next Mt.Gox meltdown will occur but I can almost guarantee it will involve Tether. So stay away from it.

**What should long term investors do?**

For long term holders a good strategy to follow each year is to capture profit each December and swallow the capital gains taxation liability, park a reserve of fiat at Gemini (whose US dollar deposits are FDIC-insured) and simply wait till around late January to early February to re-enter the market at a discount and hold all year until next December. You can keep a small amount in core coins in order to trade around various Q1 opportunities you anticipate. Others may choose to simply do nothing and just keep holding throughout January which is also a perfectly fine strategy. The cyclical correction usually stabilizes toward late January and early February, then we see a rise in March and generally are recovered by end of April. Obviously this decision whether to sell in December to profit on the dip and pay tax liability or to just hold will depend on your individual tax situation. Do your own math sometime in November and follow suit. 

Essentially revaluate your positions and trim your position sizes if you don't feel comfortable with the losses.

#How to construct your portfolio going forward
----------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than seeing the correction as a disaster see it as a time to start fresh. If you have been FOMO-ing into bad cryptos and losing money now is a time to start a systematic long term approach to investing rather than gambling.
 

**Follow a methodology for evaluating each cryptocurrency**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

Memes and lambo dreams are fun and all, but I know many of you are investing thousands of dollars into crypto, so its worth it to put some organized thought into it as well. I can't stress enough how important it is to try and logically contruct your investment decisions. If you follow a set methodology, a checklist and template you will be able to do relative comparisons between cryptocurrencies, to force yourself to consider the negatives and alternative scenarios and also sleep comfortably knowing you have a sound basis for your investment decisions (even if they turn out to be wrong). 

There is no ideal or ""correct"" methodology but I can outline mine:

**1) Initial information gathering and filtering**

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer. 

* Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account? 

* Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


**2) Fill out an Investment Checklist**

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

* What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

* What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

* Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

* What current product exists?

* How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

* What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?



**3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple** 

I have a background in finance so I like to do Excel modeling. For those who are interested in that, this [article is a great start](https://hackernoon.com/the-7-things-you-need-to-know-from-the-valuing-cryptocurrency-conference-call-c238095a03b9) and also Chris Burniske has a great blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto.

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done using his model](http://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit).  You can download this and play around with it yourself, see how the formulas link and understand the logic.

Once you have a model set up the way you like in Excel you can simply alter it to account for various float oustanding schedule and market items that are unique to your crypto, and then just start plugging in different assumptions. Think about what is the true derivation of value for the coin, is it a ""dividend"" coin that you stake within a digital economy and collect fees or is it a currency? Use a realistic monetary velocity (around 5-10 for currency and around 1-2 for staking) and for the discount rate use at least 3x the long term return of a diversified equity fund.

The benefit is that this forces you to think about what actually makes this coin valuable to an actual user within the digital economy its participating in and force you to think about the assumptions you are making about the future.  Do your assumptions make sense? What would the assumptions have to be to justify its current price? You can create different scenarios in a matrix (optimistic vs. pessimistic) based on different assumptions for risk (discount rate) and implementation (adoption rates).

If you don't understand the above thats perfectly fine, you don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do

* [Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. 

* Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

* If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price. 

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead  you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

**Think about your portfolio allocation**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. 

For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC, ETH, LTC. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain, Walton, WABI...etc

* Promising/Innovative Tech segment - Raiblocks, IOTA, Cardano...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a technie who loves the technology behind Cardano or IOTA, invest in that segment.

**Think of your ""circle of competence""**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


**Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets**

----------------------------------------------------------------------

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.


#Summing it up

----------------------------------------------------------------------

I predicted a few days ago that we would have a major correction in 2018 specifically in the altcoins that saw massive gains in Decemeber/early January, and it seems we've already had a pretty big one. I don't think we'll have a complete meltdown like some are predicting, but some more pain may be incoming.

Basically take this time to think about how you can improve your investment style and strategy. Make a commitment to value things rather than chasing FOMO, and take your time to make a decision. Long term investment will grant you much more returns as will a systematic approach.

Take care and have fun investing :)

Selling all my crypto because of an authoritarian government,14298,ldh53f,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ldh53f/selling_all_my_crypto_because_of_an_authoritarian/,,1612558800.0,False,CONTROVERSIAL,t3_ldh53f,False,1929,False,0.88,"Hi guys,

I'm from a third world country called India. The right-wing fascist government here is planning to ban all cryptocurrencies. (They are so tone-deaf they called Bitcoin a [""private cryptocurrency""](https://www.newsweek.com/india-drafts-bill-create-government-cryptocurrency-ban-private-cryptocurrencies-exceptions-1566558)). 

Of course, you can never ban Bitcoin due to its decentralized nature and you might be thinking why I am selling my crypto when I could just as easily use a VPN. Well, the answer is that you don't live under this government. In 2019, the country was undergoing civil unrest with riots in the capital in the [CAA protest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citizenship_Amendment_Act_protests) against a bill that discriminated based on religion. They silence journalists, kill protestors, and control not only just the media but also the judiciary. It's. fucked. up.

Currently, many [farmers of the country are protesting against the new farm laws](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020%E2%80%932021_Indian_farmers) which have been deemed anti-farmers and pro-corporate. The government was apathetic to the protest initially and then they were cruel, and brutal. 

[When Greta Thunberg and Rihana tweeted about the issue](https://indianexpress.com/article/india/rihanna-farmers-protest-mea-7173657/), the government lost its mind and used the Ministry of External Affairs to issue a statement... against a pop star and a teenager. The protestors are also dealt with harshly and Delhi has been turned into a fortress keeping them out; more than a hundred farmers have died but the government remains apathetic.

Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank of India prohibited all banks in India from accepting cryptocurrency transactions in 2018. However, the industry went to the Supreme Court and the order was deemed unconstitutional in March last year. The crypto industry rose in India again and just as more people were buying in, the government comes out with a bill that fines a person 3x to 10x their gains on crypto or a jail term up to 10 years, or both. 

The worst part is that the bill states that it's up to the government to decide how people should dispose of their crypto after its banned. And you know what, it's not beyond this government to take all the crypto for themselves and claim they ""destroyed it"". [All governments have a history with corruption in India](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_scandals_in_India). My exchange is linked to my bank accounts and my central government tax ID, and they can easily track me. 

That's why I'm selling everything I have, for now, just to wait it out and see what happens with the bill here. I really don't want to sell but I think it's better if I cash out instead of letting the government decide what I should do with my coins or face jail time.

I know India is probably not in your circle of concern right now but Bitcoin was about decentralization, about resisting government censorship and it seems the fanatical government is hellbent on making sure nobody can hold crypto by threatening harsh punishments and penalties. However, this is also good for crypto because the government is scared of it due to its growing power, just like its scared of Rihana and Greta Thunberg. 

I hope the bill never passes but most likely it will and bring an end to the crypto industry here again.

The fake bots will already downvote this thread but I am hoping it will at least reach some actual users in here.

Here are a few coins that I looked into that are completely scams but are widely being promoted.

Safemoon, safemars, safegalaxy, elongate, Zepplin dao, ravenX, fox finance, moon pirate, moonrate, hungry bear. Basically any coin which says ""they will give you coins for any transaction on the chain and then will burn x% more"".

The idea of naming it ""Safe"" ""moon"" should be a good enough of a red flag.  Safemoon and these other coins has 1 wallet with more than 50% of the coins. You will see a hoard of fake users/profiles just trying to promote it. These coins have no utility, it is just a ponzi scheme with the entire idea being that people who come in last are gonna be bag holders and everyone below will make a portion of the bagholders investment if you bail out early before the rug pull. These people are trying hard to get you into safemoon etc. because they wanna hoard more money and they don't give a fuck about the people who are gonna be bag holders in the end.

Do not think that lot of people are buying the coins and you are gonna be missing out on 100x gains, majority of the people posting screen shots or talking about their experience are fake profiles.

How they try to entice you?

1. They are going to show their profits
2. They are going to promise exchange listing (Binance, Kucoin, their own exchange) which will never come I promise you.
3. They say they are transparent because they put couple of stooges for some dogshit AMA
4. They come up with some charity cause to make you feel not guilty about being part of a ponzi scheme or play on your good nature in general.
5. They make the coin value be well below 1 dollar like ($0.0000001) so its more enticing to you to get in on, giving you hope that its going to reach 1 dollar someday LOL.

It's mind blowing how some people play these mental gymnastics with themselves  to justify their ponzi scheme. ""I made 100x gains"", ""is it wrong for the little guy to make money"", ""i will put 50% of  profits into legit coins"".

I don't want these shit coins to be the face of crypto for all the new comers. Stop promoting/getting into these scam coins for a quick buck, it is just gonna give crypto space a bad name.

But don't let that detract from the fact that it elevates you to the status of someone who wired $1,000 to an anonymous person on the internet in exchange for some magical beans.

You'd be stupid not to have money invested in cryptocurrency these days, but keep in mind that it's almost entirely based on speculation, and a lot of your success is based on pure luck. In a bull market, everyone is a brilliant investor. People who post here pretending to be seasoned investing gurus are more often than not people who got lucky a few times. Have fun with your Baron Rothschild memes, pretending that everyone who invests in cryptocurrency will become a millionaire.

This is not the first time in history that a generation of young people has gotten rich by jumping on a wild speculation train. People had the same attitudes at the height of the dotcom bubble. ""Twenty-five percent returns in a year?"" Those are scrub figures. Anything less than 100% is not acceptable!"" We all know how that ride ended, and this one will as well. This ride will come to an end, whether it ends in a major bust or becomes a mainstream financial tool dominated by Wall Street. Take advantage of the high returns while you can.

Lastly, If you have the money to do so you can manage your risk by diversifying. Yes, the goal of diversification is to have a completely uncorrelated asset. Because all cryptocurrencies are highly correlated with one another, diversifying requires diversifying in a completely different asset class. Investing in another coin is not considered diversification; it is equivalent to investing in McDonald's and KFC and calling it diversification. 

As always, thank you for your time."

1. Bitcoin is speculative garbage while the subreddit's coin has ""real utility"".
2. POW > POS & POS > POW - Depends on the subreddit's coin.
3. Atleast one post of someone going *all in* on the coin stating it to be the next best thing right after the internet.
4. The team behind the subreddit's coin is the best team in all of crypto and they have the best funding, best track record,  precise development schedule, bug fixes and  frequent social engagement.
5. The coin is the most undervalued project and deserves to be in the top 5, hell it should even surpass the marketcap of bitcoin, people are just waiting for mass market adoption!
6. How the coin would bring financial freedom from evil central banks and would rebuild the financial system from scratch.
7. Daily price prediction posts where OP states how early everyone is, like Bitcoin in 2009 early. To the moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
8. All the flaws in the coin are suppressed while the breakthroughs are celebrated: If OP even mentions any kind of concern, the post is downvoted to oblivion. On the other hand, any good news on the coin is reacted with, ""Finally the sleeping giant is waking up!!""
9. Fuck the whales, buy the dip!!!
10. New people are asked to buy and hodl.
11. FUD accounts present on the sub only talk negatively about the coin

His strategy was to put a few thousand in and watch the charts meticulously every few seconds. I even saw him swing trading and swapping coins, so I decided to learn everything I could about crypto and see if he was getting ""scammed."" 

I learned a lot. I watched him tell our friends to buy doge coin, saw him put lump sums into BTC and BITCOIN CASH, and heard him tell me about lots of coins that seemed like they wouldn't pan out long term and I tried to hold my breath. 

At this point (around April) I thought, hey, I know a little bit now, time to start my portfolio. I did something different than him, and put 25 dollars in each week. He kind of made a little fun of me, said it was ""cute"" that I was investing and trying, and also said it was kinda pointless to put that little amount of money in. 

Then came the ""crash"" that I was completely prepared for and mentally ready to see, and I just ... continued to put in my money weekly. He ""no longer wanted to talk crypto as much"" and stopped putting in money because all of his was already invested. 

I am proud to say that as of today (because I started building with one coin vs. His 10-15) ...

Few months ago we got a communication saying we were forbidden to buy and trade cryptos because they're not regulated and we could easily get involved in criminal activities (lol). By the way, we must have no legal records, if we commit any crime, we get fired. To prevent this situation, the bank said they would automatically block our accounts from sending money to crypto exchanges.

Officially, the bank statement said it was a decision made to protect its employees.

However, i still buy crypto, i just use another account from another bank.

Now we got a new communication about social network behavior. We are not allowed to say anything racist or violent on internet or any social network, even with our personal profile. 

The strange thing is that in this communication they included ""talking about cryptocurrencies and spreading news about unregulated markets"" which is totally not related to racism or violence (?!).

I wonder if they are breaking any law, is there someone who knows anything about European union laws?

Don’t get burned with Dogecoin,12347,mt1xzi,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt1xzi/dont_get_burned_with_dogecoin/,mark_able_jones_,1618703394.0,False,"CONTROVERSIAL POST, COMMENTS SORTED",t3_mt1xzi,False,3765,False,0.85,"Today on r/Dogecoin a user posted a video of himself: he sat in a chair, his head concealed by a pillow case, a black revolver pressed to his temple. He ranted about the lies surrounding Dogecoin and said he planned to kill himself. All I know is that he lived long enough to post the video. It was quickly removed by mods. 

So, before you buy Dogecoin, you should know what you are getting. Here’s a short summary:

Dogecoin has a huge supply. 129 billion coins. 10,000 coins are mined per minute. That’s 14 million new coins added to the supply every day, which adds up to about 1 billion coins added every eighty days. 

Bitcoin has a maximum supply of 21 million coins. So, Dogecoin mints more coins every two days than Bitcoin will ever have in circulation. That’s why doge will never be priced like Bitcoin. And, in fact, at about $9 per Dogecoin, Dogecoin would equal Bitcoin in value. 

Dogecoin has no real ecosystem to make it valuable. It is not fast: 33 transactions per second. ETH 2.0 can handle 100,000 per second. So Dogecoin can’t serve as a currency. It seems to have minimum dev work. And it’s fueled by people who think they are getting into doge early. If you buy now, you are not. Dogecoin is not the future of anything. 

With Dogecoin, you are buying hype. 

And hype might push Dogecoin to 69 cents. Maybe to $1...but there is zero reason for doge to hold that value. In fact, at $1 per Dogecoin, with 1 billion coins added every 80 days, doge would need $1 billion in new investment every few months JUST TO MAINTAIN $1.00 

Also, be aware that $129 billion (doge at $1) is a huge market cap. That’s the same value as STARBUCKS. And doge has almost zero use-case scenarios. Sure you can buy some Mavs merch. Maybe find some occasional doge fans that accept it as payment. But doge can’t scale to be a currency. It’s too slow. 

Doge, frankly, is way overpriced right now. And Doge is going to have trouble maintaining it’s value due to its always-expanding supply. If the hype falls off just a bit—doge will fall, too. And twitter’s algorithm is heavily weighted against repeat trends. You might make money with doge, but it is far from guaranteed, and there is a fairly hard ceiling due to doge’s constant supply. 

If you buy doge, you are buying hype and Elon Musk tweet energy and nothing else. 

Be careful."

Moreover, a smaller investment at first is ideal to test the waters, it gives you time to properly understand how crypto works, and do your own research on several projects.

I was also a broke college student when I put my first $200 in crypto in 2017. I wasn't really active in this sub because I felt like I was not part of this community.

""This cycle still has months to go! ETH will hit $10k!

For me, the goal when I bought in at 2017/2018 was paying off my mortgage (with of course enough to also cover any tax)

I know that most users here have only like $500 invested, so, it's easy to scream ""HODL!"" but, believe me, once you get close to your goal, those dips become scary. For me, the weekend ""dip"" wiped off $40k in value. That $40k meant not paying off the loan, ""damn, i was so close,"" I thought.

And here's the thing, I've been just above the goal for a week or so, but I held because I got greedy - I bought into the hype. That 'dip' was a nice little reminder, ""don't get greedy, stick to your goal and sell"", so I waited for the dip to rise as best as I could and for the goal figure to be reached again (luckily this happened) and I sold.

# Some history and lessons learned along the way

I've been interested in crypto for many years, so I'd like to reflect on that time and put the lessons learned from each phase into a simple table here for y'all:

|Year|What happened|Lesson learned|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Somewhere around 2010-2011|I remember talking to friends about BTC hitting $1 USD. They were skeptical and I didn't look into it further.|Learn and read more, don't listen to others.|
|2012|I looked into buying on Mt Gox but decided against it because it would mean sending personal information to Japan - I decided this was too risky.|Sometimes, you have to take a risk. Back then BTC was worth hardly anything, but my concern was a shady company in another part of the world having my passport details.|
|2013-2014|After some time away from PCs, I built a machine and decided to try some mining.

A major dip shattered that greed and helped me realise that I should stick to the plan. I sold. Don't be greedy.|

There you have it, many lessons learned throughout the years, but if I had to distill it into the most important ones:

1. **Actually use the things you're buying, test them for yourself**. Make sure you really believe in what you hold, and not just because people are saying it will moon.
2. **Buy in a bear market.** And yes, there will be a bear market, of course, maybe not now, maybe in 6 months, but there will be one. Be ready. That is where I made my biggest gains. I know, this part is hard, when things are really bad (remember when BTC hit $4k in the ""dip""), everyone loses faith and thinks, ""it's going to $1k"" - but that is just greed. DCA your way in for best results if you have to.
3. **Stick to your goals.** Don't be like me and get greedy, only to then get spooked. Thankfully, everything bounced back, but what if it didn't? I would've missed paying off my house because I got greedy waiting for ETH to rise even further.

\---

Truthfully, I will never completely move away from crypto. I believe in it long term. Hell, I had less anxiety about moving BTC and ETH around than I did about requesting my exchange to withdraw to fiat.

Who knows, everyone here is still super positive, the sub keeps getting new members (or maybe it's just people creating alt accounts?) the run keeps going, BTC hits $100k, ETH hits $10k and I will look at it like, ""damn, maybe I should've held,"" but that's OK, it's very hard to time the market and hit the top just like you can pretty much never buy the bottom.

I'll live with that because I'll have achieved at least one major goal.

I hope you guys can do the same, and I hope you have the fortitude to 'hodl' when you need to, and sell when you need to, when it's your choice.

EDIT: **Thanks for all the replies guys**. To answer some of the recurring comments and questions; yes, I sold out in phases, yes I still hold a small amount compared to what I sold (I won't shill projects here) including moons (this is an alt account). I will continue to post here and continue to post on this alt account. I've been posting here since 2017. Yes, I will continue to invest in Crypto.

EDIT 2: **So, this blew up**. I've tried my best to read and reply to as many people as possible, and of course, many scammers have contacted me (so I'm glad I posted this with my alt account), I'll add a few more things here and leave it at that since I think this honestly has too much attention for what it is, I'm just a regular dude sharing some thoughts.

1. Yes, everyone, the goal price considers my tax!
2. I'm not in the US
3. Yes, there are many financial advisors here saying that I made a terrible mistake and should've kept my mortgage. I guess everyone has a different situation and different goals, so consider their posts, even though they're having a go at me for making a dumb move - who knows, maybe their advice is right for you
4. Yes, this is real, and this is my alt account, it's not some conspiracy by whales to make you also sell. 
5. The intention here is not to scare people off or also make them sell, I just wanted to share and reflect on what crypto has been for me. I didn't want this much attention.

**TLDR;** I watched early crypto for a couple of years and did nothing. Then I dabbled with mining and got burned. Then I missed ETH ICO. Finally I got involved in the last run seriously and experienced the crash. Held till now and perhaps sold early, but thats OK."

Now I know that some names like Elon Musk can be pardoned for one reason or another but seeing Michael Saylor and Mark Cuban talk Bitcoin with the very embodiment of centralization - CZ Binance... I don't like where this is going.

Not to mention that we all expected BTC to become peer-to-peer cash, not a store of value for edgy hedge funds... It feels like we are going in the opposite direction when compared to the DeFi space and community-driven projects.


As far as I am concerned, the king is dead. The Billionaire Friends & Co are holding him hostage while telling us that everything is completely fine. This is not what I came here for and what I stand for. I still believe decentralization will prevail even if the likes of Binance keep faking transactions on their chains and claiming that the ""users"" have abandoned ETH.

Last night I was the victim of a SIM swap.,11580,nmfws6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nmfws6/last_night_i_was_the_victim_of_a_sim_swap/,Vmn551,1622144992.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_nmfws6,False,1665,False,0.95,"It all happened very quickly.

At about 11:58PM I received a text that a new phone service had been activated on my number with a carrier I don't use. It came with a link to a password protected (PIN setup when the service was purchased) PDF file that contained the contract for the start of service. I had a friend of mine crack the password to the PDF which ended up being 13371337 (lol). They filled out the form with bogus info for the name and address.

[Password protected start of service form.](https://preview.redd.it/geqpvl86wp171.png?width=1621&format=png&auto=webp&s=fcdea3cf9b228c6c2af0534b6a402ccc92d2b799)

At this point my phone number had already been stolen and my phone lost service, being unable to text or make phone calls.

&#x200B;

I tried logging into my email account, and the password had been changed. Since my mobile number was linked to my email account, the attacker was able to now use my number to get the code to reset the password. I thought I had removed the phone number from this account but apparently I missed it. At some point last year I anticipated this happening and switched most of my 2FA to google authenticator instead of SMS, which ended up saving my ass last night.

&#x200B;

At around 1:44 AM I was thankfully able to regain access to my email account by using my backup email address on file which the attacker thankfully hadn't changed, and also provided some other info to my email provider to prove ownership.

At first nothing seemed out of place until I checked my deleted messages folder and saw password reset requests for three different cryptocurrency exchanges I have held accounts on. Two of these don't hold many funds but the third currently holds a fair amount of my coins. (This is another reason you should keep your coins off of the exchange).

Time frame was as follows:

**11:58 PM:** I get a text about service being activated for my phone number, I lose phone service.

**12:08 AM:** My email password is reset. I don't notice this for over an hour.

**12:09 AM:** Coinbase password reset request.

**12:13 AM:** Kucoin verification code sent to my email.

**12:14 AM:** Kraken username request sent to email.

**12:15 AM:** Kraken password reset request sent to email.

&#x200B;

As you can see ***the entire attack lasted less than 20 minutes***, which is terrifying.

&#x200B;

Thankfully I had Google Authenticator 2FA setup on all of these accounts so the hackers were not able to gain access and drain my funds. Anyone using SMS verification should switch to Google Authenticator because this is the one thing that kept my coins safe. I still need to recover my phone number and at this point I feel like I should change my number or carrier. My mobile carrier only requires a 4 digit pincode to login and make changes which is probably one of the weakpoints that allowed this attack to happen.

My information was leaked in the Ledger breach that happened last year and I am positive that this leak is what caused me to be attacked last night. I am sure I am on a list being passed around and some of you might be as well. Please exercise caution, secure your passwords and enable Google Authentication and 2FA on everything you can.

Edit: So I spent all day at the carrier stores to get this figured out. Since my number was ported over, then cancelled, I was unable to port it back to my original carrier to finish out my month of service. I went to Metro by T-Mobile and was able to get my number back but I had to buy a new phone since my current device is not unlocked. All in all I ended up having to spend about $200 to get my number back."

The vast majority of people do not invest any kind of money into their future, all they think about is how to spend it on material stuff - as long as you're intrigued by the idea of holding a bunch of currencies that could potentially bring you financial freedom in the future - you're doing really great!

You really don't have to catch the next big thing or every single moonshot opportunity, as long as you're in crypto and chipping in funds every now and then, you're setting yourself up for great success in the future.

Once you've made substantial gains is also isn't a bad idea to diversify your investments, but that's on you. Getting out of debt is an investment too. Taking the time to understand projects and learn new things is an investment in yourself.

I wish nothing but the best for everyone joining us, but not fond of scrolling through 10 newbie threads to find a technical discussion about coins with serious use cases.

Edit: perhaps a DOGE megathread to contain it?"

**July 17th, 2020:**

Signed up on Binance, compeleted Basic verification.

&#x200B;

**August 12th, 2020:**

Advanced Verifiation Successful

Fiat Account Verification Successful

Started Wire for $100,000

&#x200B;

**August 14th, 2020:**

Sent the wire of 100k from the bank

Got an email saying they got the wire

Go to login, and the account is disabled

Got an email saying they accepted the wire 

Tried to reactivate and got an email saying 

> Your request to reactivate your account has been denied for the following reason: 7\_DAYS\_REFUSED

&#x200B;

**August 15th, 2020:**

Sent them an email asking why the account got disabled.

&#x200B;

**August 17th, 2020:**

Got a reply finally which said

**August 19th, 2020:**

We made the video and sent it in. This is in hindsight, a mess up on our part, as he sent the wire from his closed bussiness account, which is now a personal account to him. The assets of the company were sold, but obvisouly the bank account is still his. You don't sell you bank account with a business, that would make no sense since a dollar == a dollar. But this is what we replied with.

>Attached is the video. I'm having trouble with attachment size, as it only allows up to 25mb, so I have to send the bank statement in another email. I had to make the video 720p. I'll also like to add that R\*\*\* Electric Construction Inc was my business but is no longer going since I've retired. Please see next email for the Bank Statement. 

&#x200B;

**August 21st, 2020:**

Didn't hear from them, so we sent another email

>Sorry to reply again. Just trying to think of what it means about the 7 DAYS REFUSED, and the only verification that took a long time was the Advanced Verification, because I only had it half done for a week, I have quite a few emails about it saying failed during that time it wasn’t complete. I eventually finished it and have the email saying it was successful. Then I completed the Fiat Verification as well. I need the reason why it failed and what verification it was, so I know what to do. Does it have anything to do with the wire itself? If I can’t get verified for what ever reason, how do I get my money back? I’d like to just get this done and use your exchange. I’m getting worried, as I have no clue why my account was locked in the first place.

\*\*\*That is right, they asked for the same exact info we already sent them.

This time we sent the same info, but explained how the bank account was his old bussiness.

Haven't heard shit back from them. Looks like it takes them over 3 days to read two sentences. Sent them an email

Since then the account has been locked.

**November 22nd:**

 

>It has now been a whole month since I have sent you all my information proving that I own the R\*\*\* Electric bank account. It has been exactly 3 months now trying to get my money back. What is the problem here? I am losing my patience, how would you like it if a company locked your account and wouldn’t give you your $100,000 back? Why did you accept the wire transfer only to close my account a minute later and make me fight for my money? If within the minutes of you accepting the wire transfer and locking the account, that means you knew that you shouldn’t have accepted it. You guys are playing with me. It doesn’t take a month to review 5 pages of info and send a wire transfer. Do I need to buy a plane ticket and pay you a visit? Email doesn’t seem to be working too well. I have a cousin in California who is a judge as well and will take legal action. I didn’t want to play this card but I have no choice left, if this goes for another week. I want my money back. And where is the harm in sending back money exactly where it came from? I really don’t see why you have dragged this on for so long. Am I being targeted being over 80 years old? Are you waiting for me to die to keep the money?   
>  
>Don’t give me a one sentence response. I want full detail of the matter and an estimation of when that money will be back in the Ryan Electric bank account. For all I know, I am getting bullshitted by you guys, and you may not even be doing anything to fix this. Just keep dragging it on for another year, maybe I’ll be dead by then.

From here, we have nothing but problems trying to do a wire withdrawal. Sent him an email.

> When I go to the wire withdraw page, it has my name locked in and I can't change it to R\*\*\* Electric. Should I just wire it to my Greenwood Credit Union account instead, or do you think the wire will work with my name?

So we try it, and it's not working, we sent an email to him again.

> I started the wire, but I haven't received the confirmation email from Prime Trust. It's been around 20 minutes, checked my spam and everything. I added [info@primetrust.com](mailto:info@primetrust.com) to my contacts, not sure if that is the email to whitelist or not. Should I try to do another wire withdrawal?

**November 25th:**

Wire isn't working, tried a bunch of things but the confirmation email never gets sent to confirm and start the withdrawal. 

> Hey, I went to the account and under withdrawals it said failed, but like I mentioned I never got the email to confirm it. I tried again, and the same thing is happening. I attached some screenshots. 

&#x200B;

**November 27th:** 

>Hey Biggs, I’m not sure what to do about the wire transfer. I triple checked all the information and I know it’s correct. It knows the bank name automatically once I enter the information, which means to me the routing number is correct. It says failed under the status for each try I did. Even right after I put the info in, I never seen it say pending, or open, just failed. I’m not getting the email to confirm that I want to withdraw, so I don’t think your team will ever get it. I tried to use the checking account number instead of my savings and that didn’t work either. I can’t change the name of the wire to try to send it to the R\*\*\* Electric account, so I’m not sure what I should do. If you would let me buy DAI then get off your exchange, that would work, but don’t know the legality of that. Let me know, it’s been over that 72hr limit and I’m not sure what to do here.

Stuck in limbo, I tried to so a wire withdrawal 6 times, different banks, and even different account numbers for each bank. Never worked.

**December 6th:**

**THIS IS THE REAL KICKER OF THE WHOLE STORY, GET A LOAD OF THIS SCHEME.**

A little background here. I didn't try to do ACH originally because my grandparents are scared of online banking. I sent this email asking about doing ACH and if it is alright, and in the mean time, convicted my grandparents to sign up for online banking with Washington Trust, since that was the only bank that they have that was on Biances ACH list.

Mind you the account has been active now for a couple months, with withdrawals only enabled.

**December 6th:**

>Hey Biggs, my money is still on the exchange and wire withdrawals don't work it seems. Is there a way to maybe go straight to Prime Trust to withdraw it?

>That's the request ticket number that goes with the emails, incase I get someone other than Biggs. I need to get my money off the exchange, and I have been trying wire withdrawals at different times, and none of them worked. I never got the confirmation email, on 5 or more tries. I tried different banks, and accounts, nothing. I never heard back about it either. I never done online banking, but I saw ACH on the withdrawals page, and since wire isn't working, I decided to bite the bullet and enable my online banking with Washington Trust.

And that brings us to today March 5th, with no response, account still locked, and they still have my grandfathers $100k. I have expressed my situation on the Bianance forum  months ago only to be attacked by people on there, white knights and the mod Symbolic.

"Bitcoin energy usage IS a problem, and the crypto space would only benefit if everyone admitted that.",11165,n57xbt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n57xbt/bitcoin_energy_usage_is_a_problem_and_the_crypto/,postal_card,1620191218.0,False,PERSPECTIVE,t3_n57xbt,False,2471,False,0.87,"Let's be real, a lot of people here think bitcoin's energy consumption is not a problem, or it's just green people envious that they didn't make money.

The top rated post now is a post saying that banks consumed 520% more energy than bitcoin, even though the top comments are saying it's a bad argument, there still a lot of people who think the article is right, if you go on Twitter bitcoin maxis are always saying people are dumb because they don't get it how bitcoin is more efficient. Banks processed 200 billions of transactions last year against what, 200 million bitcoin transactions? You don't have to be a genius at math to see that there's no way bitcoin would win if it had the same amount of users and transactions. 

I'm not even getting into the argument that there are millions of people working for banks who likely would be working elsewhere and generating co2 emissions nevertheless. Those people work on different areas that you like it or not, are ""features"" bitcoin doesn't have, banks transaction output is not necessary related with their co2 emission because they do a lot more than sending money from A to B, you can't say the same about bitcoin, transactions = big energy output.  

""but defi is the future, we don't need banks"". You may be right, but if you look at sites like nexo/celsius, they are still companies with employees, they are competing with banks providing lendings, customer supoort, cards and insurance, not bitcoin. And they are doing fine.

""the media attacks crypto even though most a lot of coins aren't using PoW or will move to something else in the near future"". Hmmm, so you are saying there are better solutions out there and still its better to not talk about bitcoin's energy waste? Sorry, but this is just delusional. 

Crypto is at its core pushing technology forward and breaking paradigms, and with more adoption it also comes spotlight. If you look into the crypto space in 5 years and see that most coins and decentralized platforms are using something different than pure PoW, and bitcoin is still using PoW and consuming 10x energy from what it does now, you should think that's there's the possibility governments could act against mining, this year you saw hash rate drop with government-instituted blackouts in China, it wouldn't take much for countries to criminalize PoW mining if bitcoin is the only coin doing that and pretending nothing is happening while shouting ""I'm the king"". 

TL;DR: bitcoin's PoW is a cow infinitely farting, there shouldn't be negationism in this space about it as everyone else is inserting corks inside their cows butholes."

Here’s a solution. Say you wanna hold for at least 5 years, but you’re afraid your paper hands mentality will take over and you’ll sell early, here’s what you do. 

1) invest as much as you can into BTC (or whatever coin you have faith in)

2) You commit a crime that gets you that many years, maybe armed robbery? GTA? I dunno, DYOR with the crimes in your local area.

Are NFTs a potential game changer for unsolicited d*ck pics?,10867,mbmvm1,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mbmvm1/are_nfts_a_potential_game_changer_for_unsolicited/,Smemseg,1616528324.0,False,COMEDY,t3_mbmvm1,False,1091,False,0.86,"Hear me out...

Let's say you receive an unwanted and poorly composed shot of someone's junk (I'll also assume you're a lady, since they get the vast majority of them).

Don't delete that thing - mint it as an NFT and credit the sender as the original artist. 

Then, send them an invite to buy their art and remove it from the blockchain. If they don't, their name and nads will exist forever more in the very public blockchain, for all to see. 

The best part is there's only like, what, 3.75 billion d*cks on the planet, and if men get discouraged from sending them, they become SCARCE. 

The market cap potential is enormous. I've done some analysis, and predict d*ck pic NFTs could hit $1 million in the next 5 years. 

Now is the time to get involved and start DCA (d*ck, camera, action!) into this exciting new project.

Edit to add for everyone asking how you can prove its that person's dick: it's really simple. You can prove its theirs by getting them to send you another picture of their dick, and checking if they look the same. This is called Proof of Dick.

The upside of this, is that now you have TWO dick pics, so you've basically doubled your money."

Some bustard who tricked me into clicking on a dodgy link (pretending to be tech support for SNX on discord) has taken half my wallet so far (about $130k). The rest is still there but disappearing slowly in front of my eyes.

You can see all the transactions from this morning how he/she is cleaning up.

Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be anything I can do other than jumping on the occasional ETH transfer they are making in so I can sweep it out.

The only reason I haven't shared my secret phrase with the whole world is a quiet hope I might one day get it back. But if  that's never going to happen maybe I should share it with you all. After all it would amuse me if someone else steals it before @scofield#0471 takes it all.....

EDIT: 

I can see people asking why am I not moving the coins out. The answer is I really, really, really tried. 
However there seems to be script which instantly transfer the coins to a different wallet, no matter what I type in for gas fees or the address. So far I failed on ALCX, on YFI, on SLP, on AAVE - so I have given up as I don’t know what to do a setting up a script myself is beyond my abilities. Whenever I add in ETH, all it does is makes its easier to the bastard to take my coins. So all I can literally do is watch right now.

SECOND EDIT

I was sent a link to a site which was going to validate my MM extension. The site looked real enough that I clicked on it and entered my security phrase. That was where I suddenly blew up 6 years worth of HODLing in one go….

THIRD EDIT

Normally I am hyper sensitive to security and very very wary of online support from strangers. However, due to a rare combination of sleep deprivation from staying up late to watch the Euro 2020 final, and not paying attention when I should have I made the fatal error of falling for what is now obviously a elaborate con. I’m so used to clicking approve on Defi sites to connect to wallets that my guard has as down and this looked genuine enough.

By the time I realised what was happening it was too late. I logged into MM from a MacBook as my original wallet was on pc, but it made no difference. They initially took 8 ETH, some sushi and old GNT I forgot to convert. With no gas fees the raid stopped. So I thought I would be quick and add a little gas and try and take some out. That didn’t work - no matter what I big in gas fees it was either immediately outbid (lost my aave and STETH) or accepted and went to another wallet which I didn’t recognise (lost my ALCX there). Later the fucker started liquidating my assets and put gas in to do this. I managed - and this was through the most frantic clicking and accepting any fucking gas bid at the highest price  to transfer out the ETH to a separate wallet. I managed to get some out which slowed the attacks as there was no ETH to pay for the gas. This would happen every hour and I managed to get about 0.05 ETH LOL 

This was totally my mistake and not due to SNX, who to be fair, warn you not to do what I did. But I was tired, had sent a message to their tech support sub and instead of reading the warning, ignored it like a noob so yeah - I own this and it’s my fault.

To those of you who think this is fake, I hope it never happens to you. I had to take a day off work to watch this slow motion disaster - I am sitting with a sick feeling, with pounding chest and periodically start tearing up which I can only assume is a slow motion panic attack. I have told my wife who is understandably shocked. When it all goes, I get to tell the rest of family that I got fucked over through ONE SINGLE LAPSE OF JUDGEMENT.

I posted this as a warning to the bulk of the community who could just as easily have fallen for the same

I used to look down on exchanges but they all look safer as least they have 2FA which MM lacks.

I’m pretty much done now with believing crypto will only change the world for the better and for the first time have been thinking, bring on more fucking regulation and make every wallet linked to an ID  - that way one day I can find out the bastard who cleaned me out and will spend what I have left on justice.

FOURTH EDIT

Thank you so much to everyone for their sympathy and support. To those of you telling me I’m dumb /stupid / foolish for so much holding on MM, thank for the comments but after the first 100 I stopped reading them as they get dull quickly. It was a mistake to leave so much on MM and with hindsight, the fact that my ledger wasn’t letting me connect to some Defi sites was an obvious flag rather than an obstacle.

So since this afternoon, I was recommend the flashbots service on discord by some of you. With some (read massive) trepidation about using discord again, I posted my details and one of their whitehat guys Alex got in touch. 

I won’t give all the details for now as he’s still on the case but he already rescued just over 40 steth that was staked on curve as a ETH/STETH LP pool. I’m overjoyed as that’s $85k that I had written off now back (and in a ledger before any of you ask).

I’m hopeful as to what happens to the remaining $35k but it already feels like a fuck you to the thief.

Thanks to those of you who told me some of my stolen money may have gone to kraken, I’m messaging them so I hope they can freeze the money and if I’m lucky even help ID the counterpart (not holding my breath though as I don’t know ifs it’s real and whether they will help or not).

With respect to the site I clicked on, DM if you really want to know but I left it off here in case someone else clicks on it and makes the same mistake I did. I’ve got in touch with the domain hosts to ask for their help in identifying the thief.

Obviously it not the best day in the world but feels a hell of a lot better than it did a few hours ago.

FIFTH and hopefully final edit

Thank you to everyone who has sent positive messages of support, both below and in the chat. They have really helped, especially at the start when I was super stressed with indescribable feeling of watching my account get emptied in front of my eyes and being powerless to do anything about it. The (useful) advice from people was helpful and I am especially thankful that the flashbots teams was recommended.

Alex has been been awesome. After he verified that the account was actually mine he stepped to stop the bleed (and I appreciated the fact that both the groups on discord and even this sub want to fact-check this to make sure it’s not a scam or a lie to flame someone). He set up a burner to remove incoming ETH which meant the thief couldn’t take more as there was no gas on the account. He then started to work on moving out the remaining coins to a safe wallet. At the time of writing he’s retrieved 117k from the 120k that was left (using this mornings prices). There’s a bit left which will hopefully come over but given how much was taken this am, that’s a rounding error on what I lost. For those of you who need his details DM or wait as I’ll edit one last time and add his Twitter account when this is all over and I’m calm. He has been amazing and whilst they ask for a modest fee it’s well worth it.

Thanks to Kraken for reaching out and apologies to SNX if it looked like I was blaming them for my mistake. Hopefully Kraken can help but I’m also going to message a lot of the other exchanges too - anything I can do to make the money hard to get for the thief will make me happy and maybe it might even get him caught (but really not holding my breath on that).

For those of you who keep wondering (1) no, I am not doing this for moon farming as making a few dollars and getting karma in no way makes up for a hit, (2) this isn’t a new account. I’ve been on Reddit for years but am usually silent as the chats can get poisonous quickly, (3) even I knew it was risky leaving so much on a hot wallet but I have used MM for a long time and found Ledger to be challenging with some Defi. I really wish I had been more careful but that’s done. I don’t blame anyone other than myself and the bastard who stole my coins but wish MM had 2FA which would have killed this or a way to hard freeze your account instantly which again would stop the bleed and work out a recovery and (4) for all of you who are sitting on your high horse lecturing me on how dumb this is and why you should never use your private data online - I fully understand and agree with your point of view, as YESTERDAY I would have been like YOU safe in the knowledge that nothing like this would ever happen to ME…..

It’s been a hell of day but I’ll be fine with time.

SIXTH AND FINAL EDIT

Okay so it been a surreal 24 hours. For those of you who want the full sequence of events it’s basically this.

I have a few different accounts but started using MetaMask heavily in recent months. Basically because Argent was heavy in gas prices and my ledger didn’t always connect to some of the DEFI sites I stitched to MM. Thanks to a run up in crypto market valuations, and some small trades and staking, the $20k was playing with 6 months ago in the hot wallet had became around $250-260k yesterday.

My first mistake was leaving such a large amount on MM. In fact I had been actively considering moving some of it but with hindsight waited too too long. At times gas prices on ETH have been insane and was my pure bad luck that yesterday was one of the cheapest days around where tx were a few dollars rather than $20-70 which I’d seen in previous weeks. Trying to save a few hundred bucks turned out to be a very bad decision.

With hindsight, I wish I had got up and gone to work and the worst that would have happened would have been feeling deeply disappointed by the England performance the night before.  Instead I went on to make one of the most expensive mistake of my life. 

I decided that yesterday I would finally get around to messaging the help desk at the discord chat for SNX and ask if they could help me with some SNX I had deposited there on the L2 wallet. The problem was, that I was able to see the amount of SNX on their Optimism mainnet which showed SNX token only but not but not my ETH, whilst the Ethereum mainnet showed my ETH and other alts but not the SNX tokens.

I went to the sub and asked for help in the chat. Got no response and tried a bit later. That time I got 3 people replying in private chats each claiming to be from SNX. Whilst the SNX sub warns against this, I was tired and assumed that maybe it was like some of the other subs where people can advise you if the mods are busy.

To my misfortune I replied to the scammer explaining the problem. He basically told me my MM wallet wasn’t syncing back to the network and I should validate it. That sounded plausible given I couldn’t see my total balances and also in recent weeks I’ve faced a glitch as time where the wallet balance comes up a zero for up to a minute when I first open it so thought maybe he’s right.

To help, he sent a link to quite a detailed looking site which looked real enough and unfortunately, thanks to weeks of linking random DEFI sites to my MM wallet  I had become unfortunately desensitised to connecting to random pages and accepting connections to my wallet

When I tried the link on the fake site, it wasn’t working apparently so Scammer suggested I try again. This time, I figured maybe I should try the option to connect to my wallet by entering my private pass phrase. 

Yes I know it was dumb NOW

Yes I realise it’s my fault.

I’ll live with this expensive mistake for a long time.

A strange set of events in which I was super tired, not nearly alert enough and my warning radar was off meant I went for the most basic and simple phishing scam. To those of you on your high horses laughing about how this can never happen to you - good luck and I hope you carry on living perfect lives in which you never make a mistake.

A few mins pass as the scammer is still engaged on the discord chat explaining it will take some time. He then causally asks me if I have a ledger and want to sync that too….

At that instant, I suddenly realise what I’ve done and get a cold sweat. Why the fuck should he ask that unless….

I check my MM wallet on zapper.fi and see that the wallet balance has suddenly dropped. I’m now missing $20k and a quick check shows my 8 ETH, some sushi and some Golem which I had are gone. 
 
I start to get super angry that I’ve lost 8 coins. After a few mins I calm down and suddenly realise that the only reason I haven’t lost more is there is now zero ETH on my account so no way to do more transactions.

It’s likely that he must have set up a copy of my wallet on his pc and started emptying it out. At this stage I’m becoming less angry about what’s gone and becoming deeply worried about the rest.

I send frantic emails to MM which aren’t answered until late in the evening and the next morning (which basically tell me there is nothing that can be done in my case and be more careful next time - thanks guys, will never be using you again.)

At this point, the major weakness of MM finally hits me. Forget the convenience, if all goes wrong I have literally NO way to stop any transactions (hell they don’t even show in my wallet but I can see them on zapper) or freeze the account. Consensys may have built a nice chrome extension but it’s useless if there’s a problem. 

At some point I look up and see that more of my coins are disappearing. 20 odd STETH suddenly disappearing is especially painful. I check on zapper and can see he is putting in ETH to put up gas fees to move stuff off the Defi sites and liquidating my coins and moving them out. Now I’m actively watching the account on zapper. Whenever I saw ETH come in I tried to first move the coins to my ledger but every single time it just goes to another unknown wallet. WTF? I eventually understand that they have copied my account on a different pc and are probably running a script to automatically outbid me. I had watched my one YFI go - that hurt as I had spent a BTC on it lol. I watched my 104 ALCX go - another 15 ETH gone in smoke. 

My whole accounts looks fucked and all I can literally do is watch….

Around this point I send my first panicked message to Reddit that I was down 130k and likely to lose the whole lot. I figure maybe between the likely ridicule and crap I will get, maybe I will get lucky with some help. 

In the meantime all I can do is try to run slight interference by trying to move some of the ETH that the thief was adding to another account. Strangely moving ETH to another wallet appears to be the only coin I could impact. When I can moved it I try and run a tx and cancel it with a high gas fee to disrupt the ETH balance and screw up his transfers. This slows the bleeding but it’s not over and I don’t know what I can do. I read messaged here about trying other pcs, logging out of MM, I try it all and it does no good and makes me more stressed that the scammer might be stealing more when I’m not watching.

When I first posted on Reddit I was down about half with the remaining amount staked on curve (alcx/ETH LP, zrx/ETH LP, ETH/stETH LPs) which was around 120k. Don’t know why they were last to go but thank god they were there.

In between the usual trolls and assholes calling me a liar, there were messages of support and some very helpful suggestions on then flashbots discord sub (initially sent to me by the SNX subs).

I messaged flashbots and Alex from there got in touch. I gave him full info and access to my ex to verify it was mine). Even he commented that I shouldn’t do this (lost track of how many times I heard that yesterday) but as my account was already compromised I had to trust it would be okay as without it he couldn’t do anything.

He explained that he would first set up a burner so any ETH coming in would be immediately burned leaving no gas for transfers. This was quickly set up which closed the gate on the thief for the short term. 

For those of you checking the wallet history you can see some incoming ETH which then immediately is removed - that scammer’s ETH he’s wasting now. I didn’t want to alert him as to what was happening, so there was minimal mentions of this on my posts to Reddit, which I was still checking as this forum sometimes has some very useful feedback and suggestions.

Over the next 8 hours Alex managed to move the remaining balance to a hard wallet and basically recovered all of my remaining balance minus some dust and dai staked on alchemix which I can’t get back so it’s all there which was around 117k out of 120k. I don’t know how he did it - if you really want to know go to discord and ask him - but I am overjoyed that he did what he did. It’s amazing for both his stepping in and spending hours to save this and no less for his 100% total honesty and integrity. If he had moved the coins elsewhere and told me it was the original thief I would never have known.

In the end I’ve lost about 55 ETH and saved about the same (values were all over the place as the market tanked in the evening).

I didn’t post for moons or karma. I posted as a warning and for help and I’m glad I did. I would never have found the courage to trust flashbots without it. I would not have been alerted to the scammer using Kraken to deposit the stolen coins.

To those of you who offered financial support/crypto/gofundme, thank you so much but there is really no need. Alex has saved a big chunk and I will be alright. Losing this amount of coins thanks to a scam is painful but if I couldn’t stomach large swings I wouldn’t have held on for years - if I can live through a few 80% drawdowns in BTC and ETH and recover, then I’ll come back from this okay (however for a while I will stop measuring my crypto value in $ rather than #coins lol).

Thank you very much to everyone who offered emotional support and well wishes. They are very much appreciated and more than make up for the large number of trolls and morons who like to throw around shit. Please don’t worry about me. My wife, whilst initially shocked and upset, is fully supportive and I have every confidence I will do really well (especially after EIP 1559 and later ETH 2.0)

To the libertarians, outraged that I’ve swung to side of more regulation, I want to say that I still believe that you should do what you want - legally. It doesn’t have to be totally anonymous - hell half the problem with the current version of the internet is anonymous trolls venting lies and crap everywhere. 

For crypto to go truly mainstream you need some degree of safety and the ability to follow up and prosecute crimes. Watching some c*** screw me over in real time was an infuriating and humbling experience and definitely made me resent the anonymity of the scammer…..

BTW for those of you who go on about being your own bank good luck and come back to the real world where actual banks are regulated and safe (unlike the current Wild West of crypto Defi) and remember many of us don’t want to be our own bank. I never thought about being my own bank and bought coins like ETH for other reasons. I like the blockchain and the crypto space as they are exciting and disruptive ideas that will hopefully make a new version of the internet in due course and change the world. However like the internet 2.0, no matter how it starts, eventually governments will step in and more regulation is coming. 

Mr scammer, I’ve already reported you to a bunch of exchanges where you seem to be staking your stolen coins and even if I can’t get you immediately, your records are permanently there on the blockchain and one day you will be fucking found….

Finally thanks again to Alex!

It crashed almost 100% in a few hours and now sits at 0.00000005% of its ATH. That's something. I've seen many people in the past two days ask stuff like: ""sure, it won't recover from that. But what if I just invest like $10, if it goes back to even just one cent, a tiny fraction of the ATH, that would be a ton of money!""

And yes, it absolutely would be! And that alone should be enough to tell you that it can't be this easy. The thing is: because of how that whole network works, a lot of TITAN was printed when it crashed.

10 days ago, the circulating supply was 116 million. Now it's 34 **trillion**, or 34,000 billion, or 34,000,000 million. Yeah, that's a lot. So let's consider the market cap, which is:

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

A coin price of 1 cent would mean a market cap of 344 billion, putting it on the #2 spot, higher than ETH. At 2 cents it would get close to BTC, at 5 cents its market cap would be higher than all other crypto combined.

On iron.finance, the creators of the coin state ""WARNING: Please don't buy TITAN or IRON."". Listen to them. This coin doesn't have a chance to go up again and as always, coin price is a bad indicator, even if it used to be higher."

20% dip? 🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me.,10390,lqqc1q,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lqqc1q/20_dip_looks_pretty_normal_to_me/,bose25,1614107437.0,False,COMEDY,t3_lqqc1q,False,737,False,0.92,"It's April 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s making around 1.1 BTC each day. The price is crossing $2. 

It's May 2011, I am mining on some number of Radeon 5850s, doubled. Mining difficulty is climbing quickly, and so is the price. We're almost at $10 by the end of the month and I'm still making around 1 BTC per day, somehow managing to stay on par with the difficulty as I buy more graphics cards.

It's early June, and as I am powering on even more GPUs, the price hits roughly $32 before halving over that weekend. 

November 2011, we reach $2 after several months of everyone declaring it dead. I am on something like 8 5850s now, probably still making around 1BTC, maybe a bit less, it's difficult to remember after 10 years. After the monstrous crash of about $30, things begin to pick up by the end of the year and we enter 2012 at about $5.

We crash from $7 to $4 between January and February, then from $13 to $8 over one weekend in August. It's dead, each time.

It's 2013 and things are batshit insane. We have some minor 10% drops through the year but everyone is buying. Everyone is mining. I heat my new rental property with Radeon 7990s and only heat the house with graphics cards during the entire winter from 2012-2013. About 11 steps up the stairs, you go from freezing cold to being blasted with heat, like when you exit the plane into Spain.

By April we all lose our shit and people are buying bitcoin for $100. By the 9th they are paying $200 and within a week decide that $70 is more reasonable - a 66% drop in a week. Of course, people can't make up their minds whether Bitcoin is a scam or if it's the future of humanity, so the price goes haywire and we see regular gains and drops of 10/20/30%.

It's November 2013. Bitcoin is not a scam. Clearly, because it's now worth $200. Or is it worth $650? No, it's worth $550. Now it's $700. Nope, $1,100. Now it's $950. 

Now it's December and it's $1,100 again. But what the hell is going on, MtGox won't let me log in despite me not sleeping and spending the last 15 hours through the night trying. Now I'm late for work and I've lost 20% of my money, even though I've actually gained 1000% this year, I'm only bothered about losing 20% of what I had a day ago, just like literally everyone else.

It's 2014. It's also most of 2015. The entirety of both years. Bitcoin is dead. Never coming back. We're down to $200. Mining still makes me the same $2-3/day that it ever has, even though the 1BTC/day from 2011 is now worth $200+/day. I give up. Everyone else gives up after buying these new things called shitcoins. I forget, not bothering to sell what I had left as it's barely enough to buy a small used car. 

It's 2016 and apparently Bitcoin has tripled since I last looked at it. What. You what. What. Everyone now wants Ethereums. It's like Bitcoin, but it'll fit on my hard drive. Everyone's shitcoins have disappeared. The however many thousands of Doggo coins I mined before I quit have disappeared along with the exchange. Ethereums are bringing out these new shitcoins that actually do something, like Golem, which is like Seti@home but will eventually literally do everything and generate an income for you. Great! Ethereum shitcoins are not called shitcoins. The world of cryptocurrency is very different to how i remember it. I swap half my BTC for ETH and then 80% of that for various tokens.

It's 2017. Nothing bad is happening. Everyone is investing in ICOs for non-shitcoins. Everyone's making $2k/day just trading. Everyone's also making $500-2k/day just holding. Everyone has bitcoin and ether, as well as a tonne of ERC-20 tokens. Some people also have Bitconnect which seems very much like the HYIPs I used to join during my PTC/PTS days as a teenager. Seems like a scam, no good. Ethereum has several 20-30% drops throughout the year. Seems normal, I'm no longer phased after 2013. Everyone in my office is interested. They all discuss it at $10, but ask me about investing $15k when the price hits $300. Finally, they enter at $600 and no one does any work for the rest of the year. We just talk crypto.

It's the second half of 2017. I make more on crypto in one day than at my day job in a month. Literally everything is going up. No one considers that it'll ever drop again. I'm like: ""🤷‍♂️ Looks pretty normal to me, but I better sell some soon else..""...

Actually, it's January to April 2018. New York bonuses or Chinese New year or some seemingly random event makes everyone sell literally everything. Everyone had put all their bitcoin into ether, and then all their ether into ICOs. What was once 25BTC was now 400,000,000 various ERC-20 tokens, or kittens, worth around $200. Not only did everyone sell their tokens, causing them to crash, but everyone sold everything else, making everything else crash. Crashception. Every second word on reddit is ""crash"".

Ether went from $1,200 to $75 in a year or so. Declared dead by everyone.

It's 2018-2020. I'm like, well, not sure. Probably will repeat the cycle of dips, moons and crashes, but probably should have sold. How many Deloreans could I have bought? Better not check my ""How many Deloreans I can afford if I traded all of my cryptos for deloreans.xlsx"" spreadsheet. My heart and soul must be dead. I have felt no emotion or regret during the crash. 2013 had used up all of that. All of my colleagues are bored and stop talking about crypto. Despite what they said, they weren't interested in the tech, only the money. One buys a folding phone for $1,500 with what was once $10k of Galaxy Ripple chocolate bars, I think. I buy more Ether, deciding to not exchange any for other tokens. From now on, only BTC and ETH for me. I buy some occasionally, but not as much as I should. I pretty much leave crypto will the expectation that we'll just repeat it all again in a few years.

It's 2021, things are batshit insane again. Already?Woopdedoo. Everyone's talking to me about crypto. Fgs. I just decided to try the real stock market where people cry over a 3% crash. Everyone is jumping back in. What is defi and nft? Are cryptokitties nft? Is my kitty still alive? Who knows. Give it 5 years and there'll be a yet another new equivalent to shitcoins.

Bitcoin drops by $10k in January, I'm like, meh. I play with Coinbase Earn and shortly make a mint.

It's the present: Bitcoin drops another 10k in February, even though it's still higher than the last drop. I'm like, meh. Everyone panics. For some reason I decide to write a 20 word reddit post and it turns into whatever the hell I'm writing now for whatever point I'm trying to make. Something about not declaring it dead over a $10k drop when we're still up by $20k this year.

It's mid 2021. Bitconnect is back and they want your doge. Bitcoin hits $80k but crashes by 20% down to $64k. The world is on fire and shit is hitting the CPU fan. It crashes by another $5k before hitting $85k. Ether was $4k but now deemed dead because it's only $2k. Soon it'll be $5k. Elon tweeted about doge being the national currency of Mars. It's a joke, but now doge is $42 and I remember that old exchange that vanished with probably $420,000,000 worth of my doge, and 50 LTC. Twelve seconds later it's back to $0.10. Everyone is mad because it is now only worth double of what it was worth yesterday, even though it is down from ,12 seconds ago.

It's every other year from now until the end of eternity.. Everything crashed by 50% overnight. Now it costs me 250 satoshis or less for my latte. Ether is $1^26 or something and no one knows what is happening anymore. The price went so high because 10 billion people on Earth use it daily, either directly or because their car automatically pays for tolls on the Ethereum network with that project from Oaken Innovations that hasn't been updated in years, that now no exchange can display it correctly or something. Everyone is now an NZT or NFT or POS or some other acronym. While I'm working, my phone earns me 0.2 GLM, my fridge earns me 4 MYST, my washing machine earns me a few E-DOGE, all while I process medical simulations and allow some family in China to access wikipedia without their government seeing. My family on Mars send me some DOGE to keep me afloat. Ripple is still being investigated by the SEC while their owners siphon another $100m each year. The price of all cryptos goes 10x every other year but it's all dead when it drops 10-20%.

It's the end of this post. I've no idea what's going on. Has the crash reverted in the time that I've written this? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I lost today? How many Deloreans worth of crypto have I gained since the start of the year? I look at the price of literally every crypto and see a 10% drop after an unlimited % gain since inception and several hundred percent just this year or so.

Its the end of the end of this post. I consider how to end it, but instead have two endings. Things don't make sense. I consider changing the title to reflect my original intention of pointing out how a 10-20% drop is pretty much to be expected with crypto and that by looking at the bigger picture, you won't even see this dip on a chart next year. Instead, I do whatever I am doing now. I give up and decide to post this so I can use the reddit app to check if anyone has posted anything meaningful about NuCypher, even though I expect the usual pump posts."
I'm been in crypto since 2013. Maybe 700+ alt coins and many trades. Now a Defi-Crypto Farmer. Here are some of my tips and advice for new-comers.,10361,moilxv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/moilxv/im_been_in_crypto_since_2013_maybe_700_alt_coins/,Cryptodragonnz,1618108668.0,False,STRATEGY,t3_moilxv,False,1336,False,0.9,"As the title says I'm into crypto pretty deep.  I was in crypto briefly in 2013, but only really hit the ground running in 2017 and never looked back.  In 2017 I made all the usual mistakes, got into the wrong coins, entered some dodgy exchanges and sold the wrong coins (like selling Enjin on its first day after investing in the ICO).  In 2018 things got worse, with shitcoins driving the BTC value of my holdings down by half.

Now I'm sitting really pretty and feel like I have ""clicked"" to the point where I am generally making money in crypto and quite a few people ask me for advice on what to do, strategies etc.  Here are some of my tips, observations and ideas.

1. Don't trust anyone.  Assume everybody you are talking to is a friendly thief who wants your money.  That includes people shilling particular coins, or anyone asking for your crypto to invest, to random people that message you.  (And yes ironically this means don't trust me, but you'll see I didn't mention my altcoin holdings and I am deliberately staying quiet on what my 800% defi pool is  :) )
2. Every position you enter should be a fixed percentage of your portfolio.  I prefer 1% for a typical trade.  Risky uniswap gems might be 0.5%, very strong longer term positions say 2-5%.
3. Have your portfolio value in BTC (or ETH if you prefer that).  Your goal is to increase your BTC value.  Each trade should be from BTC, and then exit back out of BTC.  Log all transactions in blockfolio etc under the BTC pair, so you can see how much BTC value you are gaining.  Don't worry as much about USD gains, as in a bull market its easy to make USD value gains.  BTC is the end-game here so you want to accumulate BTC, especially if BTC dominance is falling.
4. Have a portion of your portfolio allocated to farming or staking.  If you have a coin sitting somewhere for ages, ask if there is some way for you to make money from it.  For example, I have a large stack of BTC and ETH, so rather than have it sitting doing nothing, I wrapped the BTC and entered a Sushi Farm.  Months later the rewards from that farm are worth something like 25% of the amount I initially invested.  Every so often, harvest the rewards and either re-farm (compounding) or shift to your long term hold.  Remember compound interest.  There are opportunities for very high returns (without ponzi aspects but be careful) - find those, constantly take and re-invest the income and the gains are quite extreme.
5. Have a dedicated stack of BTC or ETH that is your ""HODL"" portfolio that you never touch.  Preferably in seperate legal entity (like a trust) than what you trade with.  This will help for taxes.  Every so often, move some profits into that long term stack.   I don't do anything with that stack at all, it is just my safe holdings.
6. Spend as much time learning about tax as you do trading.  Tax is something you kind of need to understand upfront - you can get way more rekt from bad tax approaches than you make gains with good trading.  And keep your records safe - download all trade histories at the end of every quarter.
7. Use telegram (or discord).  Find really helpful smart and useful people and stick to them.  Find helpful trading groups.  Eventually they will be a vital source of information or just ways to bounce ideas off.  Check out my previous post for a full guide on ""must have"" telegram groups.
8. Read the crypto news as much as you can.  Its amazing how often something pops up (e.g. grayscale announcing new trusts with other coins) and there is still a decent amount of time to buy.  And always have some BTC on an exchange ready to buy on such an opportunity.  Again, telegram is great for this as you can quickly see tweets or news-links being shared.
9. Have a preset % of gain or losses whereby you will sell if it reaches that.  For example, for most coins, if a coin ever goes up more than 30% vs BTC in a day I always sell.  95% of the time that works out as better than holding.  In the rare event I double my position I always sell the principal immediately (I did this twice this year - with Ethernity and Blind Boxes).
10. Always have an idea as to what the current ""climate"" is in terms of what is moving and in favour.  Crypto markets often move with certain sectors at a time.  For example, if you look at the Coin Gecko categories list, you can immediately spot what is ""hot"" right now.  Last month it was NFTs, so I was heavy in that space, but now that sector is cooling.  The binance smart chain and exchange coins are doing very well right now - if that is the case what else might move?  Well other low gas blockchains could be an idea - especially if they have defi - so Avax, Raydium etc are all moving too.  Soon it might well be BTC's time to gain as the expense of alts.  You should be rotating in and out of positions to try and go with the ebb and flow of the market.
11. For newcomers, start with basic stuff like accumulating bitcoin, learning to use a wallet, security etc.  Don't just dive in and ape into defi coins, wsb style.  It may suck that it feels like you are missing all the gains from the ""hot"" new coins, but it will equally hurt if you are just burning through your capital.
12. Look out for free crypto opportunities.  They key here is sorting out the gems from the scams.  This isn't just staking etc but also things like reddit moons and airdrops.  A lot of people are even ""airdrop farming"" whereby you have wallets that carry out certain activities deliberately to try and qualify for future airdrops.  Coin market cap earn and coinbase earn are two more.  Even something like the binance ""dust"" feature to turn dust into bnb is a way of generating some more bnb (even if its tiny).  Check out my previous post on free crypto and ways to get passive income
13. For farming, make sure you are using the right apps like zapper or apy vision to track all your positions, your yield and any impermanent loss.  That will also help with tax records down the track, should you need it.  Watch out for farming on the ETH network as your gas fees will chew up any gains if you have small positions.  Check out my previous post of sushi farming for how the rewards and gains work
14. Track all your numbers, your gains, your investments and portfolio change religiously, preferably in an excel document.  That way you'll know how you are performing and if something is going wrong.  Again, I wish I had done this more in 2018.
15. Have an ""emergency reserve"".  For me, this is actually my stock positions, many which are crypto related, but you could have gold or cash (I especially like the idea of something like stable coins lent on FTX at a decent interest rate).  If we get some kind of crypto turbo dump which is 40%, you can then have that as money on the side-lines ready to buy.
16. Constantly educate yourself.  For me, I still need 3-4 hours a day to research and learn about crypto.  I find crypto podcasts and even youtube vital sources of information, provided you are listening to the right people.  Mix up your education with news, technical strategies, trading updates, altcoin news and even just the general philosophy behind sound money and financial sovereignty.
17. If you win or lose on a trade, delete that coin from blockfolio immediately.  Why?  Because you have exited that position, and seeing it jump up again in price is just going to torment you.  You've made the decision to sell, don't even up revenge trading where you come back and try and get your losses back on the same trade.
18. Never margin trade UNLESS it is only because you want to minimise your funds at risk on an exchange.  Even then I'd avoid it.  Unfortunately many exchanges make this very hard to use - and there are confusing terms and default options which can rekt you (for example, positions that will drain your other funds instead of liquidiating the trade if falls too much).  In fact, I avoid almost all USD pairings and only trade BTC pairing, unless very special circumstances are in play (such as ripple being delisted from coinbase).
19. Never hold more than around 10 coins.  I used to have up to 40 at a time, it became impossible tracking them in terms of activity, prices, and god the horrors of trying to maintain enough wallets for them.  10 is enough diversification.  I used to have a ""bag"" of around 15 moonshots - that strategy never worked as even if one ""Gem"" actually made it big, the losses from the other ones cancelled out.  Typically if I had a huge gain from one of my coins, I sell back to BTC and waits for other opportunities.  This isn't Pokemon - don't try and ""catch them all"".
20. Falling in love with alt-coins is like falling in love at a stripclub.  Yes trade them.  But just be conscious that their chances of beating BTC long term are very unlikely.  Just look at all my 2013 gems (peer coin, feather coin etc).  Heck I bought World-Coin because I read about a ""bitcoin genius teenager"" who made millions from crypto and said World-Coin was the next bitcoin.  And I've made my mistakes as well going forward, holding on for dear life for nano (yes I know its fast and instant!) and grin.  I think the tech for both coins is great, that doesn't mean its a great trade.  If you want to marry your alt-coins then you will be lucky if you only lose half your money like a real world divorce :)
21. EDIT. Bonus one.  Always learn from your losses (and I have MANY).  I like to think of crypto as like a computer game where you are gaining new skills.  Think of RPG games like Baldur's Gate or Warcraft.  You can earn money or experience, and use that to gain new items or skills that protect you against certain things.  So maybe you lost $500 to a ""rug-pull""?  Well do your research and figure out how to avoid that next time.  Maybe you'll spend the next 2 weeks mad about it, but next time a potential rug-pull project comes along you'll dodge it - congratulations you now have learned ""immunity to rug-pulls"".   Keep learning and gaining more experience and you'll start avoiding all the traps.
22. EDIT 2:  You are going to have MANY scenarios where you see a coin that has gone x1000 or to some ridiculous crescendo, where you feel utterly compelled to buy to avoid missing out.  This is the obvious trap (if you want an example of this look at Safemoon right now.  Bitconnect was the one in 2017 and there are others).  At some point bitcoin or ethereum will do a similar run up, and many people outside crypto will do the same thing.  Yes this can be irresistible but you must resist the temptation - think of the cryptos has being a bunch of boats on the wharf, and there are thousands of boats.  Every day another hundred turn up.  Why are you going to try and jump across the water to get to the boat that is already leaving, when if you wait a bit another few dozen will turn up in five minutes?  You'll just fall in the water and miss out on those new boats!
23. If you must trade as a new-comer, I highly suggest trading the smaller / middle cap BTC pairs.  Not the USD or margin pairs.  Certainly not something like futures contracts on FTX.  Why?  Because if you are on bitmex / bybit / ftx etc you are swimming with the whales and sharks, quant funds, robo-traders and the like.  If you entered the casino for the first time in your life, would you immediately go to the blackjack table with James Bond and Dr Evil?  The smaller BTC pairs are more likely to have less experienced traders - my trades actually went positive once I moved from USD pairs on margin exchanges to spot BTC trades with altcoins.
24. Last edit before bed (I promise).  The chances are, crypto is still cyclical.  That means we will have another bear market, or at least a very long boring period of no gains.  If you have just joined crypto, you probably won't ""make it"" this cycle, as we may only have 6 months to a year to go.  I actually lost money (a lot) in BOTH the 2013 and 2017 bull markets (-50% and -85%, respectively).   All of my gains were made in the bear market when I was buying BTC and alts when BTC was in the 3ks.  The ""will you make it?"" test isn't coming now when the market seems to be going infinitely up and everybody is winning.  That test comes when everybody is selling and it seems like you are the only buyer.  And yeah, thousands of alt coins will suffer or die at that point.   So be around to scoop up the ashes - don't be the ashes!  This is all a larger part of learning to move with the cycles.

Anyway these are the ones that come to mind, hopefully that is helpful!  No doubt I'll edit this post and add a few more."

The bot was initially designed to buy Bitcoin when Elon Musk tweets about, regardless of the sentiment of the tweet. I have shared it with some smaller communities, and there was some great feedback on it regarding the main concern - what if Elon tweets: ""Bitcoin is too high imo"" and the bot buys at the wrong time.

So I found an API that would help me analyse the tweet sentiment, and integrated this into the code. The bot will now only buy Bitcoin when Elon Tweets, if the sentiment of his tweet is positive.

I have tested the functionality and the bot is quite stable, but I haven't tested how profitable (if at all) it would actually be, so if you're interested in testing it, please share the results with us! :)

The bot was built mostly for fun, and I wouldn't encourage you to trade with it on a live account! But if you want to have some fun with it and try it out on a demo account, here you go:

The U.S. debt-to-GDP ratio may well hit 200%, but the poorer and smaller nation of Japan is doing OK with similar debt levels. Keep in mind that national wealth, while difficult to estimate, may run as much as six to eight times higher than GDP. So a 200% debt-to-income ratio could mean a debt-to-wealth ratio as low as 25%. That’s hardly the end of the world. Think of how comfortable you’d be if you paid off “only” 75% of your mortgage.

If anything, crypto is more likely to hurt the currencies of countries that are doing very poorly, [such as Venezuela](https://www.coindesk.com/bitcoin-adoption-venezuela-research). Fiat currency won’t just go away, so over the long run crypto could actually boost the value of the dollar by stifling the rise of potential competitors. Don't downvote this just because it doesn't fuel the confirmation bias, just think rationally."

If that seems comically low it's because it is. It's a world record for total amount of money managed per employee. 

The only similarly small number of employees for such a large amount of money under management was Bernie Madoff's ponzi scheme which had $50bn under management with just 25 employees. [Source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madoff_investment_scandal)

--------------------

What benefit is there to having such a low number of employees? Lower costs yes but with the money they control and need to invest surely it would make sense for them to have more than just 13 employees doing this? 

Or is it because it's easier for them to conceal fraud when there's only a handful of people being exposed to it and most of them have a large interest in keeping the fraud going.

Tether has just under $30bn in commercial paper ([source](https://www.ft.com/content/342966af-98dc-4b48-b997-38c00804270a)) which makes it one of the largest US commerical paper market investors in the entire world alongside the likes of Vanguard (17600 employees) and BlackRock (16500 employees). **THIRTEEN EMPLOYEES EVALUATING THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF NEARLY 30BN IN COMMERCIAL PAPER LOANS AND WITHOUT THE OVERSIGHT OF AUDITING.**

I always see these posts a lot, but for some reason more in the past few days:

*""what are the best coins under $X?""*

And sure, it looks like that makes sense - Bitcoin (BTC) is super expensive already, while a coin like BitTorrent (BTT) is available for less than one cent! If you buy some now and they become as expensive as Bitcoin you will be rich! Bitcoin also used to be cheap! Right?

Lol, nah, wrong, obviously. The thing is: coin price doesn't matter. At all. Because it is strongly affected by how many coins are in circulation. There are currently about 18,700,000 BTC in circulation, there will never be more than 21,000,000. But there are 660,000,000,000 BTT at the moment and there will be 990,000,000,000 at some point. The important figure is the market cap, which is

**Market Cap =  Circulating Supply  X Coin Price**

So, for example, for BTC it would be  49,500 X 18,700,000, about 920 billion USD. So if we imagine BitTorrent becoming just as big as Bitcoin, how much would a single coin be worth? $1.38. So can't a single BTT be worth thousands of dollars, like BTC is? No, absolutely not. If 1 BTT would be worth 49,500, as 1 BTC currently is, its market cap once all the coins are in circulation would be almost 50,000,000,000,000,000. 50 quadrillion, or 50,000 trillion. The total amount of wealth in the world is about 300 trillion.

**tl;dr:** Coin price is NOT a good indicator how much a coin can still grow. Check the market cap and compare it to other coins to see how much a coin would need to grow to be as big as another coin. [The Coin Perspective](https://thecoinperspective.com) is a great website to make these comparisons. Also remember that you can buy fractions of a coin, like 0.001 BTC and don't have to buy a whole one."

If you don’t know what “market cap” means and you’re trying to get in early on “moonshots,” I’m begging you to take 2 minutes to read.

Market capitalization is the total value of all members of an asset. Just circulating supply * price. (Edited note: worth mentioning that you should be using the average price over different platforms. THAT BEING SAID: if the platform you’re looking at shows a price that would imply a market cap in the quadrillions, then that DOES mean the price is too high there. Even though the market cap calculated by that price wouldn’t be an accurate measurement of the combined value of the coin, it IS a good indicator of whether or not it will actually be able to maintain that price. If it’s not an accurate price, arbitrage is going to correct the price soon enough.) 

What does it tell us? It lets us know how much ~~money~~ value is attributed to it, and how it compares to other coins.


Take SHIB for an example. It has a circulating supply of **400 trillion tokens,** so at its price of 0.003¢, it has a market cap of nearly $12 BILLION. That’s 1/5 of doge’s cap of $60B, and it is therefore already one of the largest cryptocurrencies out there.

At 10¢, the market cap would be $40 trillion, double the US annual GDP. It will not hit 10¢. It will not hit 1¢z It will not hit 0.1¢. It MIGHT hit 0.01¢ because of how the market has been working lately, but those other targets are just mathematically far too high.

(Another edited note: when I say reach that price, I meant having a stable price that high on most/all trading platforms. Thanks to those of you who corrected me on that)

The creators want you to see all those zeros in front of the price and assume buying it would be “getting in early.” Don’t let them fool you. You are not getting in early by buying a coin with a $12B market cap. You are almost certainly very very very late.

DYOR. Please.

Edit:

A lot of people are hung up on “how much money is in it.” I didn’t mean it in terms of principal investment, I meant it in terms of valuation. I have a lot of BAT that I bought at 30 cents. I don’t value it as if it were the 30 cents per token that I bought it at, because I know I can just sell at the market price if I need to.

The argument that it would crash if everyone tired to sell at once is fallacious. It’s valued at what it is and it ISN’T crashing to nothing from everyone selling at once because people aren’t trying to all sell at once. They would rather have the BAT than the $1.30. If they didn’t, they would have sold already.

Edit 2:

Think I came off wrong here. Not a financial expert, that much is obvious. I know that things can crash from everyone selling, I was trying to say that everyone selling is BECAUSE they value the coin’s value in fiat/btc/eth/whatever less than they do the coin.

Second, I know there are flaws in it, as it can’t be instantly converted. I’m not trying to make it out to be some perfect metric of value. My intentions here are solely to tell people that their millions of scamcoin that they bought for $10 probably is not going to make them a 9 figure crypto whale.

Edit 3: u/ReachOutLoud broke down problems with  a lot of my points. If you’re interested in actually learning more, their [comment](https://reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/na0jwv/_/gxsrlqu/?context=1) would be a good start."
EXPLANATION: The recent crash was probably due to margin accounts having a cascading crash on Binance.,8705,mt5odv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mt5odv/explanation_the_recent_crash_was_probably_due_to/,Fragsworth,1618718355.0,False,TRADING,t3_mt5odv,False,1990,False,0.9,"Degenerates on Binance with up to 150x leverage (borrowing Tethers to buy crypto) have been building up their margin account balances to big numbers, and when they make money, they double down, and build even bigger positions. Because they're degenerates.

But when the price dips below a certain point, some degenerates who have these margin accounts are suddenly below their maintenance limits, and they get liquidated. When they get liquidated, Binance will sell your crypto for Tether, and you are left with little to nothing.

So what happened? Crypto got sold, and Tether got bought. Because Crypto got sold, the price drops, which triggers more accounts, who thought they were safe, to dip below their margin maintenance requirements.

This creates a feedback cycle which basically ends in the liquidation of all the margin accounts. It all ends in a very fast, cascading crash like we just saw.

The bad news is the price is lower, but there's a silver lining. The good news is the market is in a healthier position after this. Most of the unsustainable degenerate margin accounts are probably gone. If we go up to $60k in the next week, it's not because of borrowing (as much). Going forward, at least for the near term, another event like this is not very likely.

The price we see right now could be thought of as being closer to the ""real"" price which we would have had without the degenerates.

TLDR: Fuck Binance

And fuck the rest of the exchanges with 150x leverage bullshit

EDIT: Some people wanted more evidence to support this theory, so I suggest you look at the price differences between the exchanges (Binance vs. Coinbase, for instance) during the crash. You'll notice the exchange with leverage was significantly lower in price, which suggests bots were arbitraging Coinbase down to match it. Additionally, note the Tether price during the crash, which went up to $1.05.

But I wanted to share my happiness with someone, and I thought I’ll share it with you guys 😋.

Some people who have recently joined cryptocurrency contacted me through DMs asking me for tips. I thought i’ll just post it here.
 
If someone wants to get into crypto to get its feeling, without throwing in their own money. Coinbase earn and WeNano are both nice legit options for you to earn some crypto worth ~$40.

And do try to get these links and apps on your own through the app stores, please do not click on links that are shared by someone in your DMs. Just a healthy practice we all should follow to keep ourselves safe."

While the entire crypto community has been publicly tying to educate Senators on these laws, she has been making calls behind closed doors trying to arm twist the Senators into bringing in these draconian regulations. ""Shadowy""

As it turns out she has also been getting paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. And she is brining in regulation that kills decentralised competitors to banks, who have so far enjoyed near monopoly when it comes to controlling people's finances. 

As Treasury Secretary, she is paid by the US Government to regulate banks - a role that requires the highest standards of ethics and moral turpitude. But she has collected $7m from the same banks that she regulates! Including Citi, Citadel Securities etc. How, without impartiality, can she regulate these banks that are paying her millions of dollars in speaking fees?

Imo - public officials paid by the government should not be collecting millions from the same entities they regulate. This is nothing but grift. While it is not per se criminal, because she was doing it when she was not a Govt official, but nevertheless these payments were received between her 2 terms as Treasury Secretary. 

The ethical thing for her was to not accept the role of Treasury Secretary in the new Biden Administration, because she was aware she had been paid by the banks she is supposed to regulate. But despite all this, she took up the job. clearly indicating her lack of morals and ethics. 

She really needs to STEP DOWN. The crypto community must unite to get such greedy grifters out of public policy for good, if we need to have a fair chance at our decentralised future."

Welcome to the scary part of crypto.

It's uneasy for all of us.

But it's at these times gains are made. Not by trading (for some, sure) but by studying and planning your strategy. Now it's time for you to do your research on which coins you believe in and align your bags accordingly. 

**It's true what they say, ""Time in the market, beats timing the market""**. So don't over-leverage, don't sell high or on the way down, and stick to projects/coins you believe in. If you believe in crypto, your goal is to still be in this game years down the road. 

And it's way more profitable than jumping ship from coin to coin depending on what's pumping. Plus you will learn a lot along the way.

Once you've aligned your bags accordingly, all you need to do is to lay in a coma, trust your intuition and try to keep yourself from refreshing prices 24/7. 

This part is difficult for all of us to do, but it's important. Doing this is a lot easier if you have hobbies or things you're passionate about outside crypto. So try to pick up a new hobby or do something that keeps you from looking at charts every 5 minutes and FOMO into any shitcoin that's pumping this day. 

Best of luck to all of you."

3. When asked if Crypto has any ""intrinsic value""? - There is an intrinsic value and relation of the value of bitcoin and the cost of mining it.

A Beginner's Guide to Cryptocurrency Wallets,7897,lkkm0v,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lkkm0v/a_beginners_guide_to_cryptocurrency_wallets/,Weaver96,1613416183.0,False,SECURITY,t3_lkkm0v,False,1024,False,0.96,"A cryptocurrency wallet is basically a software that enables you to track, send and receive coins through the blockchain like a bank account. Every wallet has a public key and a private key, but we'll get back to this later. But first...

# Why do you need a wallet?

There's an old saying in Tennessee that says: **""Not your keys, not your coins.""** What it actually means is that if you keep your cryptocurrencies on an exchange (such as Coinbase, Binance or Kraken), you don't actually own those coins, because you don't have the keys to the related wallet. You gain access to those wallets by logging into these exchanges, but your account can - theoretically - be deleted in the blink of an eye, or the exchange can get hacked, attacked, etc. And with it, your funds can disappear forever. If you want to learn more about this, make sure to look up Mt. Gox's hacking. It is an unfortunate event, but one that puts you on guard. 

So you already know that you need to own your keys in order to own your coins. **But what are these keys?**

Your **public key** is what identifies your account on the network. Think of it as your email address, because when someone wants to send you cryptocurrency, they will send it to this address. 

Your **private key** is a string of 64 characters that can be generated from a 12-word seed phrase. It basically serves as the password of your account. It is used to sign transactions and to prove that you own the related public key. 

See, it's not that complicated, is it?

# About wallet types

There are 4 types of wallets that you should be using. Ideally, you can pick the one that fits your crypto habits the most. You should avoid using Web wallets. As always, if you can, please pick the safest wallet type in order to minimize the risk of losing your cryptos. 

**Hardware / Offline / Cold Wallet** \- an offline storage device (e.g. hard disk, USB stick). You might've heard the names Ledger or Trezor, these are the 2 biggest brands at the moment. The ledger supports over 1200 cryptocurrencies, while Trezor supports over a thousand. It is also the most secure way to store your cryptocurrencies. 

**Mobile Wallet** \- applications that are installable on your mobile phone. Beware that even though an app can hold crypto, it doesn't mean it is NOT custodial. (e.g. Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is custodial, meaning that they control your coins.) Exodus or Atomic mobile apps are recommended if you decide to create a mobile wallet.

**Desktop Wallet** \- wallets that are installable on different desktops and are compatible with Windows, Mac, and Linux. Your keys are stored on your computer, and you can use this wallet even when you're offline. Note: Desktop wallets tend to be more advanced than mobile wallets, and usually come with more technically complicated features that can increase privacy or allow for more flexibility when it comes to signing transactions.

**Paper wallet** \- a paper wallet is essentially a piece of paper including your public and private key, or a QR code (so that you can quickly scan them and add the keys to a software wallet to make a transaction). It's a really safe way to store your cryptos because your keys are not connected to any servers. The only way someone can steal your cryptos is if they steal this paper.

# The Best Hardware Wallets

**Ledger Nano (S and X)** \- The most popular hardware wallet brand in the world, currently sells 2 different sticks. The S is the cheaper alternative, but if you handle transactions between multiple cryptocurrencies frequently, the larger storage of the Nano X should be more convenient. The Nano X also has Bluetooth 5.0 support. You can read more about Ledgers on their website. 

Beware that **Ledger was targeted by a cyberattack that led to a data breach** in July 2020. A larger subset of detailed information has been leaked, approximately 272,000 detailed information such as postal address, last name, first name, and telephone number of our customers. However, not a single coin was stolen as hackers didn't gain access to private keys. Please keep this in mind when making your decision. 

**Trezor (One and Model T)** \- Trezor is the other popular hardware wallet brand. The Trezor One is the cheaper alternative ($59), while the Model T is more expensive but comes with extended functionality and additionally supports cryptocurrencies such as ADA, XMR, XTZ, etc.

Despite the security of hardware devices themselves, **the weakest link is always the people using them.** If possible, avoid buying used hardware wallets, even though both Trezor and Ledger have security measures to avoid the attempt of installing malwares.

# The Best Desktop Wallets

**Exodus** \- a very user-friendly and easy to understand, reliable wallet. As of now, it is probably the most popular desktop wallet. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux as well. 

**Atomic** \- it is also a user-friendly and reliable wallet. Atomic supports 500+ assets and allows staking various cryptocurrencies. Available on Windows, Mac and Linux.

Of course, there are several other reliable desktop wallets, but these two proved to be the most user-friendly and easy to use wallets so far. As always, please DYOR!

**If you decide to go with a mobile wallet** (instead of a paper, hardware, or a desktop wallet), Exodus or Atomic are both available on iOS and Android. Please avoid installing 10+ crypto wallet applications on your phone, because you'll make it impossible to keep track of your keys and passwords eventually.

Last piece of advice: always be cautious and double-check everything. Keep your devices malware-free, and don't click on anything suspicious (such as emails from ""Binnance"", crazy bonus links from ""Coimbase"", etc.)

When going to pay at the counter, the cashier asked card or cash? I responded by saying that I can pay with Nano which is fast and feeless, arriving in their wallet in under 1 second.

She looked a little funny at me and said they only accept Visa or Mastercard. I responded by saying that this isn't dirty centralised fiat money which is being hyperinflated to nothing by ""money printers going brrrrr"" (I made hand signals to emphasise how fast the printing is).

At this point she looked really scared but I think that's because she understood the reality how badly the dollar value is being inflated.

She called her manager to presumably explain this amazing opportunity, whilst I pulled out a map of some Nano faucets we could go to and test out how amazing Nano is.

The manager said I can take the meal if I promise to leave immediately. I'm assuming it's because he was so excited to close up and start adopting Nano.

I can't believe it, not only is Nano fast and feeless but it also gets you free things!!! This is real world adoption and I can't wait to get every single McDonald's on the Nano train.

P.S. Please don't harass front line workers. Remember that most people don't know about cryptos and try not to come of too strong when trying to get adoption."
Everyone always says “DYOR” but never shows you how to DYOR. Here’s a comprehensive guide to doing your own research in the crypto space.,7699,owihb6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/owihb6/everyone_always_says_dyor_but_never_shows_you_how/,dragondude4,1627922775.0,False,EDUCATIONAL,t3_owihb6,False,895,False,0.94,"## 1) Initial information gathering and filtering

Once I identify something that looks like a good potential investment, I first go to the CoinMarketCap page for that symbol and look at the website and blockchain explorer.

- Critically evaluate the website. This is the first pass of the bullshit detector and you can tell from a lot from just the website whether its a scam. If it uses terms like ""Web 4.0"" or other nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and has anonymous teams, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past.

- Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. Look for red flags like massive portions of the float being assigned to the founders of the coin, vague definition of who would use the coin, anonymous teams, promises of large payouts...etc

- Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts holding or selling? Which account is likely the foundation account, which is the founders account?

- Read the subreddit and blogs for the cryptocurrency and also evaluate the community. Try to figure out exactly what the potential use cases are and look for sceptical takes. Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?


## 2) Fill out an Investment Checklist

I have a checklist of questions that I find important and as I'm researching a crypto I save little snippets in Evernote of things that are relevant to answering those questions:

- What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve?

- What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized?

- Who is their competition and how big is the market they're targeting? What is the roadmap they created?

- What current product exists?

- How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional?

- What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?


## 3) Create some sort of consistent valuation model/framework, even if its simple

A simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

- Metcalfe's Law which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic.

- Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply.

- If its meant to be just used as just a currency: Take a look at the circulating supply and look at the amount that is in cold storage or set to be released/burned. Most cryptos are deflationary so think about how the float schedule will change over time and how this will affect price.

Once you have a model you like set up, you can compare cryptos against each other and most importantly it will require that you build a mental framework within your own mind on why somebody would want to own this coin other than to sell it to another greater fool for a higher price. Modeling out a valuation will lead you to think long term and think about the inherent value, rather than price action.

Once you go through this 3-step methodology, you'll have a pretty good confidence level for making your decision and can comfortably sit back and not panic if some temporary short term condition leads to a price decrease. This is how ""smart money"" does it.

## Think about your portfolio allocation

You should think first in broad terms how you allocate between ""safe"" and ""speculative"" cryptos. For new investors its best to keep a substantial portion in what would be considered largecap safe cryptos, primarily BTC and ETH. I personally consider XMR to be safe as well. A good starting point is to have between 50-70% of your portfolio in these safe cryptocurrencies. As you become more confident and informed you can move your allocation into speculative small caps.

You should also think in terms of segments and how much of your total portfolio is in each segment:

- Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum
- Smart contracts platform segment - Ethereum, Polkadot, ALGO, Solana …etc
- Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash …etc
- Finance/Bank settlement segment - Stellar ...etc
- Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment -VeChain ...etc
- Promising/Innovative Tech segment: NANO, ADA, Tezos ...etc

You should also think about where we are in the cycle, as now given so much uncertaintly its probably best to stay heavily in core holdings and pick up a few coins within a segment you understand well. If you don't understand how enterprise solutions work or how the value chain is built through corporations, don't invest in the enteprise blockchain solutions segment. If you are a techie who loves the technology behind a coin, invest in that.


## Think of your ""circle of competence""

This is actually a term Buffet came up with, it refers to your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Think about what you know best and consider investing in those type of coins. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain will achieve adoption? 

This where your portfolio allocation also comes into play. You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every category and for every type of crypto you come across. If you had over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well.


## Continually educate yourself about the technology and markets

If you aren't already doing it: Read a bit each day about cryptocurrencies. There are decent Youtubers that talk about the market side of crypto, just avoid those that hype specific coins and look for more sceptical ones like CryptoInvestor. If you don't understand how the technology works and what the benefits of a blockchain are or how POS/POW works or what a DAG is or how mining actually works, learn first. If you don't care about the technology or find reading about it tedious, you shouldn't invest in this space at all.

It got to the frontpage with about 8k upvotes. If you read the article you will see that:

&#x200B;

1. It's from March 12, not recent.
2. Any ""proposed bill"" needs to be approved by both legislature houses (House of Representatives and Senate). It was only approved on the House of Representatives, so it effectivelly wasn't ""passed"".
3. It's already dead on the Senate [as you can read here: ""Status: Engrossed on March 8 2021 - 50% progression, **died in chamber**](https://legiscan.com/GA/bill/HB681/2021)""

With this guide I would like to help you getting started with learning the basic fundamentals of DeFi and setting up your wallet and tools. I tried to make this guide as complete as possible.

# Fundamentals

Let's start with some fundamentals first.

# What is Decentralized Finance

Decentralized Finance (DeFi) is a movement that uses decentralized networks and blockchains to transform traditional financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that work without intermediaries.

Currently, almost all DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum blockchain and Binance Smart Chain (EDIT: Binance Smart Chain is NOT as decentralized as Ethereum and is therefore often labeled as CeDeFi). Like Bitcoin, Ethereum and Binance have a blockchain that acts as a shared ledger in which digital value is tracked. Rather than a central authority, the participants making up the network control the issuance of ether (or BNB), the network's cryptocurrency, in a decentralized way.

Developers can program applications that can create, store and manage digital assets, also known as tokens, on the blockchain. For this to work, smart contracts and decentralized applications (DApps) are written and built. The expiration of these contracts and agreements is automatically enforced if the blockchain receives the correct data. You can make complex, irreversible agreements without the need for an intermediary.

Anyone is able to create, adapt, mix, link or build on an existing DeFi product without permission. DeFi protocols are modular, so they can be stacked on top of each other to build an increasingly dense system of interacting parts.

# Wallets

You can download a wallet on a PC, tablet or telephone. With this you can store, send or receive Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. Three related concepts determine whether someone has ownership of a certain wallet, these are your digital keys (also called public & private keys), your wallet address and your digital signature.

The most important aspect of a wallet are your digital keys, as they give you access to your wallet. It is important to know that these keys are not stored online on the blockchain but are instead stored independently within the digital wallet itself. Each key consists of both a public key and a private key.

Consider your public key the same as the bank account, which also consists of an address. Your public key works more or less the same. The pin code with which you subsequently gain access to this bank account is then referred to as your private key.

It is very important that you ALWAYS keep your private key to yourself. If someone else has the private key, he / she can send and steal all coins, so keep it safe. With the public key, people can only send coins, so that can't hurt.

Every wallet has a unique code, which we also call the wallet address, which consists of a random letter and number combination that is different for everyone. This address is in fact the name of your wallet and makes it possible for others to transfer cryptocurrencies to you.

Example of just any bitcoin address: 14J5Q7ageKhM3miKd94DX44Kf6b7ko4BZe

Some people assume that your public key is the same as your wallet address. This is not entirely true, but the two are mathematically related.

In order for you to start using DeFi platforms, a browser wallet is needed.

# Coins vs Tokens

A coin runs on its own blockchain, on its own system. It is therefore completely independent. A coin could be compared to a contemporary currency, such as the Dollar. Bitcoin is a coin and has been developed with the aim of serving as a digital payment method and store of value.

Then there are tokens. Tokens by definition do not run on their own blockchain, unlike a coin. They have been added to an already existing blockchain. Tokens can have the same functionality as a coin, although this is not common.

Tokens that are created on the Ethereum network are typically ERC-20 tokens. When we talk about ERC20, we mean the standard that is implemented in certain tokens. ERC20 stands for 'Ethereum Request for Comment 20'. The Binance Smart Chain uses a similar standard, which is the BEP-20 standard.

These standards contains numerous functions that allow any token that has implemented this set of functions to be traded. Examples of those functions are:

* Sending tokens.
* Request balance information from any address.
* List the number of available tokens.

# Layer 2 solutions

Because of high demand, the Ethereum network is getting overloaded. This resulted in very high transaction fees, making it to expensive for small investors to use it's dapps.

This is the main reason why many investors moved to the Binance Smart Chain, which has much lower fees, untill Ethereum 2.0 has been implemented, which is an update that will drastically lower the transaction fees for the network.

However, in order for the Binance Smart Chain to maintain such low transaction fees, it had to sacrifice it's decentralized properties. This resulted in that the Binance Smart Chain is much more centralized and less safe compared to Ethereum.

Fortunately, there are various projects working on Layer 2 solutions to improve both the scalability and speed of the Ethereum network. Layer 2 refers to a secondary framework, chain or protocol that is built on top of an existing blockchain system. By doing so, the mainchain can be unloaded and can solely focus on the safety of the network.

In the case of Ethereum, there are currently 2 sidechains that are pegged to it. These chains are the xDai chain and the Polygon chain. The latter of the sidechains is the most promising Layer 2 solution so far.

By bridging your assets from the Ethereum mainchain to the sidechains, you are able to interact with various dapps that work on these sidechains for almost an negligible amount transaction fees.

# Getting started

Now that you're aware of the fundamentals of DeFi, let's dive into how you can move your assets into the various DeFi protocols.

# Setting up your wallet

In order to move your assets from your wallet on the exchange that you're using to either the Ethereum network, Binance Smart Chain, or Sidechains, you will need a browser wallet that can interact with these DeFi protocols.

I'm currently using MetaMask, so I will use this browser wallet in this guide:

1. Go to the official MetaMask website in your browser ([https://metamask.io/](https://metamask.io/))
2. Press “Get Chrome extension”, “Chrome Firefox Opera” or “Get Brave Browser”. This of course depends on the browser you want to use at that time.
3. You will now be taken to a page where you can add the extension. With Chrome, for example, there is a button with: + ADD. TO CHROME. Click on the button.
4. A popup appears to confirm this
5. You will now see a MetaMask logo at the top right of the browser. Click this to set up MetaMask.
6. Accept the terms and conditions
7. Create and confirm a new password. Please remember this password.
8. You will now see 12 words. With these words you can always recover your wallet - in combination with the password. Write these words down and keep them safe. Preferably offline - just on paper.
9. Congratulations! You have now installed and configured a MetaMask extension. You can now use the buttons “Buy” and “Send” to buy or send Ether to your wallet. You can now also send Ethereum to the address under “Account 1”.

Your MetaMask wallet will be automatically connected to the Ethereum network. In order to connect your MetaMask to the Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or xDai, follow these steps:

1. Click on the network in the top right corner.
2. Go to settings.
3. Click ""Add network""

In order to setup your wallet for the Binance Smart Chain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: Smart Chain

New RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)

ChainID: 56

Symbol: BNB

Block Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/)

&#x200B;

In order to setup your wallet for the Polygon sidechain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: Matic Mainnet

New RPC URL: [https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/](https://rpc-mainnet.maticvigil.com/)

ChainID: 137

Symbol: MATIC

Block Explorer URL: [https://explorer.matic.network/](https://explorer.matic.network/)

&#x200B;

In order to setup your wallet for the xDai sidechain, enter the following parameters:

Network Name: xDai

New RPC URL: [https://rpc.xdaichain.com/](https://rpc.xdaichain.com/)

Chain ID: 0x64

Symbol: xDai

Block Explorer URL: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet)

# Faucets

In order to be able to perform transactions on these chains, you need to have some of their coins/tokens in your wallet in order to pay for the transaction fees.

* In order to use Ethereum you need Ether
* In order to use Binance Smart Chain you need BNB
* In order to use xDai you need xDai
* In order to use Polygon you need Matic

Luckily you can get small amounts of the currencies for free from so called faucets.

A faucet is an app or a website that distributes small amounts of cryptocurrencies. They’re given the name “faucets'' because the rewards are small, just like small drops of water dripping from a leaky faucet.

However, in the case of crypto faucets, tiny amounts of free or earned cryptocurrency are sent to a user’s wallet. In order to get free crypto, users need to complete tasks as simple as viewing ads, watching product videos, completing quizzes, clicking links (be careful!) or completing a captcha.

You can use the following faucets to receive small amounts of crypto:

* xDai: [https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet](https://blockscout.com/xdai/mainnet/faucet)
* Matic: [https://matic.supply](https://matic.supply)

Unfortunately. I wasn't able to find any faucets for Ether or BNB.

# Sending crypto from the exchange to MetaMask

In order to receive send your assets to MetaMask wallet, you need to fill in the correct address. This is probably straight forward for most of you, but please make sure to quadruple check you're MetaMask wallet address before sending your tokens from the exchange to your address.

When you're sending tokens from Binance, it will ask if you want to send them as BEP20 or ERC20 tokens. Please choose the correct one! Sending BEP20 tokens to your Ethereum address can result in a loss or they end up in your Binance Smart Chain wallet.

# Bridging: An important step!

Please notice that you can't send your tokens directly from the exchange to sidechains such as xDai or Polygon! You need to send them first to the Ethereum network (as they are both sidechains pegged to the Ethereum blockchain). Once received, you can bridge them to xDai or Polygon by using the following links:

* [https://bridge.xdaichain.com/](https://bridge.xdaichain.com/)
* [https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/](https://wallet.matic.network/bridge/)

Keep in mind that for during the bridging, Ethereum transactions fees have to be paid. After the bridging, you play by the rules of the sidechain (which means cheap transactions).

# I can't find my tokens in my wallet!

If you can't find your tokens back in your wallet after sending them from the exchange, you can follow these steps:

* Check the transaction record, is the transaction completed?
* Make sure you look at the right network. Your MetaMask wallet might be connected to the Binance Smart Chain network, hence not showing your assets.
* Add the contract address of your token to the wallet. You can find the address of your token via [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/) (Ethereum) or [https://bscscan.com](https://bscscan.com/yieldfarms) (Binance Smart Chain). The token address can then be copied in to the MetaMask wallet by clicking on add custom token.

# Setting up your dashboard

To make things a bit more clear, I would advice you to use the DeFi dashboard [Zapper.fi](https://zapper.fi/). Zapper is an interesting platform that lets you quickly and easily deploy and manage your DeFi positions within a single interface. It is a DeFi portfolio management dashboard that helps you stay on top of your portfolio, liquidity pools, and liquidity mining positions.

Zapper supports Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, xDai and Polygon. In order to connect to the right network, you must first connect your MetaMask to the network you want zapper to connect to. By clicking in the top right corner of your MetaMask wallet you can connect to the network you want Zapper to manage for you.

The first tab of Zapper, shows an overview of your account. It shows the value of your assets in your MetaMask wallet and how your deployed assets are performing in the DeFi protocols (if you deployed any already).

In order to reduce gas fees, Zapper has several features that can ""Zap"" your assets fast and ""cheap"" in order to:

* Start providing liquidity in a pool.
* Swap tokens.
* Bridge your tokens from one network to another.

Zapper also keeps track of the estimated APY's (Annual Percentage Yield) of the various pools from different DeFi protocols as well as farming opportunities.

# A list of DeFi protocols

Before wrapping this post up, I want to share the following website: [https://defipulse.com/](https://defipulse.com/)

DeFi Pulse records the top performing DeFi protocols on the Ethereum main chain as well as their TVL (total locked value) and ranks them accordingly. This page is really worth checking out as it can help you to pick the right protocols to deploy your assets in.

In order to monitor the DeFi space of Binance Smart Chain, Polygon and xDai I like to use [https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi](https://dappradar.com/rankings/category/defi) and [https://defiprime.com/#defi\_projects](https://defiprime.com/#defi_projects). However, If you use other resources in order to find the right dapp, let me know!

# That's it for this guide!

I really do hope that this guide helps you to get started on your DeFi adventure.If I missed something or whatever let me know so I can change it.

EDIT 1: All right, there’s some confusion here whether Binance Smart Chain is decentralized or not. It’s NOT decentralized. The Binance Smart Chain is a fork of the Ethereum blockchain that sacrificed it’s safety and decentralized aspect in order to maintain low transaction fees and higher scalability!

EDIT 2: As pointed out by some comments, this post doesn't explain WHY you want to use DeFi. Unknown to many, this guide is part of a long series of posts, called ""DeFi Explained"". If you're interested in why you should-/want to- use DeFi, the following posts will be useful for you:

I'm a new comer to the world of crypto. As I was doing my research on alt coins I found market cap to be essential in understanding the relative size and the potential upside of different coins. I found myself constantly doing mental math using CoinMarketCap data, so I decided to build myself a little private website to help with all that! Example: ""_if coin X had market cap of coin Y, it would be worth $Z_"". I figured others are probably in the same position, so I published it yesterday for the world to use. :)

I proudly present to you **[thecoinperspective.com](https://thecoinperspective.com/)**!

**Features:**

- Supports the top 500 non-stable coins/tokens as per CoinMarketCap data. I can add more, if required.
- Quickly see impact of different market caps using a slider, as well as input a hypothetical amount of coins to calculate total worth.
- Supports multiple reference fiat currencies (USD,JPY,GBP,CHF,CAD,AUD,HKD,CNY)
- Coin data is auto-refreshed every 3 hours, including Fiat exchange rates
- Mobile friendly
- No ads, no spam (LPT: use uBlock Origin if you don't already)

I'm still tweaking the UI -- if you have suggestions let me know.

**EDIT**: Thanks for all the feedback!
- Now supports Dark Mode (will default to your OS preference)
- Now supports manual input
- WIP: advanced view, where you can specify all the parameters!


Hope this helps someone. 

p.s. Full disclosure: I piloted this website yesterday in a specific altcoin's subreddit and feedback was very positive and their suggestions helped me drastically improve the website. Now it's a bit more polished and I've worked up the courage to post it in such a big community. Fingers crossed :)"

Sold a large chunk during the previous bull run in 2017, and sold the remaining in multiple sales this January. Averaged about a 150x on my cost basis across all sales. All long-term capital gains. Now I'm 27 and financially independent. Will be buying my parents a house this year.

I know things are a lot right now and this dip is scary, but also right now you're ok. Walk away from the charts for a while, enjoy your friends/family/pets and come back after a while. This shit happens all the time in crypto and we are still solidly in the midst of a bullrun. Give the whales time to shake out weak hands in order to scoop up more on discount. If you can buy the dip, if you can't buy the dip just hold and you'll be ok if you just have patience.

If you're panicking right now, maybe reconsider how much you have invested or what coins your invested in. This is a volitile space and your mental health is more important than some quick gains. Take care of yourself, stay hydrated, check your posture, and keep a big picture perspective."

Technical analysis is the study of statistical trends, collected from historical price and volume data, to identify opportunities for trade. Technical analysts observe patterns of price movements, trading signal and other analytical tools to evaluate the strength and weakness of an asset.  

Technical Analysis can be applied to any security with historical trading data such as cryptocurrencies, forex, commodities and stocks.

A chart of prices and volume represents all the past decisions taken by market participants (buying and selling). This information will, in turn, affect future participant decisions in two ways:

* **Psychological**: What you did in the past affects how you approach future situations. For example, many traders tend to focus on the price at which they bought an asset, and if it declines, they want to sell when it reaches break-even again.
* **Reflexive**: Some traders identify trends and chart patterns which are common, and act accordingly (buying or selling). If a sufficient number of participants follow the same strategy, it is expected that these chart patterns will follow the expected outcome and that the trend will likely to be sustained by more and more participants joining the trend.

**Bollinger Bands**

Bollinger Bands display a graphical band (the envelope) with a simple moving average in the middle. The width of the envelope expresses the volatility.

Volatility refers to the rate at which the price of an asset can increase or decrease. A higher volatility means that the asset can potentially **fluctuate rapidly within a larger range of value**.

**Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD)**

Moving Average Convergence Divergence (or MACD) is a trend following indicator that looks at the combination of two moving averages:

* A short-term moving average
* A long-term moving average  


These two moving averages are combined to identify what is the current trend and if there is a change in the momentum.  


The MACD lines displayed below can be interpreted as follows:  


* If the blue line (MACD line) is above the orange line (Signal line), the momentum is bullish.
* On the contrary, if the blue line is below the orange line, the momentum is bearish.
* When the lines diverge, it denotes a strengthening of the current trend while a convergence shows a trend reversal.
* When the lines cross, it is likely that the change in momentum is confirmed.

Thank you all so very much, it truly means a lot!! I posted a [video walkthrough](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myc_KexWcrY) as well for anyone interested.

# Summary

Hi all, it's your friendly data science guy! There are many opinions on how high ETH can reach this cycle, so I looked at the data to get a better answer.

**In 2017:**

* **ETH Dominance** (ETH/Total Crypto Cap) ranged from 9% to 18% (peak) to 30% (July 2017)
* **ETH/BTC** ranged from 0.007 to 0.1 (peak) to 0.15 (June 2017)
* **ETH** was overvalued by \~4096% in 2018 peak relative to logarithmic regression

**In 2021**

* **ETH Dominance** (ETH/Total Crypto Cap) held at 7%
* **ETH/BTC** held at 0.016

**Takeaways**

* If we look at ETH Dominance and ETH/BTC tables below, the average of the likely scenarios in red box are in the **upper 8k range**
   * The total crypto market cap went up by 55x from 2013 peak (15B) to 2017 peak (830B)
   * In 2021, it is certainly not impossible for crypto market cap to go up 5-10x from 2017 peak
* ETH will likely hit a resistance at 1T market cap. Given that this market cycle is faster than last cycle, its possible that we will peak out sooner in \~Aug/Sep. ETH at 1T market cap (adjusted for increased supply) in Aug is  **8,511**
* If we look at ETH Log regression in August and apply a similar over-valuation, it puts ETH at **7,805**
* The most likely outcome is that **ETH will reach \~8k this cycle** and any higher is statistically unlikely.

This subreddit above all else is supposed to be a hub of news, useful discourse, information, and understanding of cryptocurrencies/crypto assets in general. Through it I've found some amazing coins and made investments that I would have never known to make.

But that's only because I didn't listen to the trash level sentiment being carried out and the hardcore tribalism that causes people to lose out on good, solid investments. So here, lemme break this into 3 categories:

**FOR THE INVESTORS**

It has become incredibly clear to me that FAR too large of a portion of our reader base on this sub is entirely unaware of the fundamentals of investing in new tech. This is not a sports team, this is not some TV show or fad, THIS IS A BRAND FUCKING NEW ASSET CLASS THAT CAN REVOLUTIONIZE OUR SOCIETY. And it is MUCH too early to be acting like we've already made our correct bets and that nothing can happen to change the trajectory of our favorite project.

1) How is the TECH/Whitepaper? (this should always be your FIRST question)

2) How is the Dev Team?

3) Do they have a funding scheme? What kind? (community donation, venture capital, institutional investment/buyouts, ICO etc.)

4) How are they organized?

5) How is their track record?

6) Do they have any institutional or prolific backing?

7) Does it solve a goddamn problem or alleviate friction anywhere?

8) Does it have competition and where does it stand within that?

9) How close to ready is it?

10) Any plans to create, stimulate, and maintain adoption?

11) Does it have a Marketing and media presence? A good one?

12) How is its Mainstream visibility?

13) How about Accesibility and Liquidity?

14) Growth potential based on current price and supply

15) Can it survive or at least get around the regulatory hammer?

Regardless of what you think your coin's shit smells like, these are the things you need to know in order to decide where the hell you're putting your money. Because each and every single one of these questions is important in determining the value potential and sustainability of your coin. If you actually care about making money then you'll shed your need to be on a single team and diversify your assets based on the fundamentals. Yes, I know a month feels like an entire year in crypto, but investment is NORMALLY supposed to be a multi-decade affair. Meanwhile longterm for most of us means 2022 at the latest. DO YOUR OWN RESEARCH.

**FOR THE DAY TRADERS**

In general, you have a very simple job. Look at graphs, do some TA, make a plan, invest based on that and do your best to have orders and trading set up that minimizes risk. So just do that. I don't want to hear a single one of you coming through a subreddit and moaning about how you think something is a shitcoin because it wasn't volatile enough that day to make you dumb amounts of money. No one is saying you aren't making hella money or that you aren't right from a daytrading perspective, but keep that to the trading subreddits where other like-minded people are actually impatient enough to care about that. You should understand that when you put up some pissy comment like that, new investors who haven't the faintest clue on anything will take what you say seriously and model their money movement around your words.

Think about that.

If I had listened to day traders, as a mid-long term investor, I'd have missed out on NEO (back when it was Antshares), ICX, and XRP. I would have missed out on the following percentage gains:

NEO: 1150% Gains as of now
ICX: 5080% Gains as of now
XRP: 1720% Gains as of now

^Why would I want to miss out on that because of impatience and bad philosophy?

**FOR THE SUPPORTERS**

For people who are genuinely in this for philosophy, that's great, discuss the merits of your philosophy and vision and why you think the coin aligns with that. Otherwise:

SHUT THE FUCK UP.

If you don't, you'll start spreading FUD and lies, it's inevitable, the second you decide to trash another coin you're going to do it as a way to feel superior regardless of how good or shitty your investment is.

I'm done."
"The Bitgrail hack was months ago, bomber defrauded new users of their assets to pay off old users. This is a criminal act. We need to contact the EU/Italian authorities & make sure he's punished.",6949,7wlo19,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7wlo19/the_bitgrail_hack_was_months_ago_bomber_defrauded/,Rezzz8080,1518272396.0,False,SCAM,t3_7wlo19,False,878,False,0.93,"Let's be clear here Francesco Firano (/u/TheBomber9) is a criminal. The hack was in November which means that he's been insolvent for months & has been defrauding new users out of their money to keep the exchange afloat. Once the Binance listing was imminent he locked all the exchange's assets. His actions show clear intent. If his exchange was hacked & he immediately reported it to the police, he'd just be incompetent but by hiding this from new users he transitioned from moron to criminal. 

This is the US legal definition of Fraud:

* Fraud. A false representation of a matter of fact—whether by words or by conduct, by false or misleading allegations, **or by concealment of what should have been disclosed**—that deceives and is intended to deceive another so that the individual will act upon it to her or his legal injury.

[In order to be convicted of fraud in the US, the following must be proved:](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/fraud)

>Fraud must be proved by showing that the defendant's actions involved five separate elements: 

> * (1) a false statement of a material fact,

>* (2) knowledge on the part of the defendant that the statement is untrue, 

>* (3) intent on the part of the defendant to deceive the alleged victim, 

>* (4) justifiable reliance by the alleged victim on the statement, and 

>* (5) injury to the alleged victim as a result.

Now I'm not a lawyer but it seems to me that he is clearly guilty & convictable. It's likely the EU/Italian definition is the same since fraud is a universal crime. [He may also be guilty of running a ponzi scheme](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/ponzi_scheme)

We need to make sure people don't get away with this sort of thing. I don't want to say he's destroyed people's lives because there is almost always a way to recover but he has certainly severely damaged peoples wellbeing. 

I'm in the US but if someone in the EU/Italy could contact the authorities & let them know about the situation maybe we can get a little bit of justice for his victims. I don't trust him at all when he said he has reported this to authorities, it's **very likely he completely misrepresented the situation to them** even if he did (which is also a crime).

If you live in the USA & are a victim please call the FBI to file a report. Apparently extradition is possible between the USA & Italy. If there is enough outcry about this situation maybe we can get the wheels turning.

Edit: [He's also guilty of embezzlement](https://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/embezzlement )

> Elements common to embezzlement are as follows: (1) the property must belong to a person other than the accused, such as an employer or principal; (2) the property must be converted subsequent to the defendant's original and lawful possession of it; (3) the defendant must be in a position of trust, so that the property is held by him or her pursuant to some fiduciary duty; and (4) the defendant must have an intent to defraud the owner at the time of the conversion.

Edit: Evidence he knew about the hack (personally I think it's borderline impossible for him not to realize he's missing over 3/4ths of the XRB in his wallet but here's some hard evidence anyways).

I'm HODLing my coins for 5 years plus, which is great because I don't need to check the chart everyday as the rises and falls don't affect me. 

That's why I've signed up to multiple trading platforms, studied Wyckoff, enabled push alerts, open trading view every 4 minutes, close the chart, re-open it, read the latest crypto news, condemn bearish trends, avoid the FUD, check the sub-reddits, comment on every post, resist the FOMO, provide unwarranted technical analysis, evaluate impulse waves, predict future trends (incorrectly), check staking rewards every 30 mins, mark support and resistance levels, record trading volume, declare bull runs, track whales and erroneously declare that everything I hold is going to the moon. 

See, it really is so much easier to HODL. No sweat whatsoever. 

Thanks and see you all in 5 years :-)"

What rubbish, if FBI can empty anyone's wallet they can get BTC from the top addresses and all become billionaires themselves. This is some of the weakest FUD but people still seem to be falling for this.


Edit: Lots of comments seem to suggest that governments are developing or have developed ""quantum computers"" that can crack/hack bitcoin private keys. While quantum computers can definitely become a threat to cryptocurrencies in the future, they are not presently anywhere close to being capable of deriving the private key for a bitcoin address. 

As per u/BreakingBaIIs : 

> I did a back-of-envelope calculation that showed that it would be faster to mine all the remaining bitcoins 6 billion times than it would to crack a single private key using brute force.

> If the FBI found a way to efficiently crack a private key, that would mean they solved the most important math problem humanity has ever faced, that P=NP (in the affirmative). What they could do would go far beyond breaking all of the Internet's security protocols (which they could do). They would be able to solve all the mathematical theorems that humanity has ever worked on for thousands of years, plus many new ones we never thought about, in a matter of days or hours. They would be able to efficiently create superhuman AI using modest computational resources.

The complexity of cracking a single BTC private key is large and currently not in existence. 

Moreover, if such a powerful computer existed, it would be a threat to several other things rather than bitcoin and crypto. The entire internet runs on cryptographic encryption. Nothing would be safe. In fact, someone in possession of much less powerful quantum computing power can easily hack into Federal reserve and transfer out every dollar there, or hack into Bank of England and shut everything down. In other words, cryptocurrencies would not even be among the top threats, because much bigger and important threats would be easily taken over. 

If they had quantum computers, they wont be asking Apple to de-encrypt devices seized from criminals. 

If they have quantum computers that can reverse engineer the private keys to any BTC address, they wont bother recovering measly 60 BTC from the 80 BTC ransom, when they can just send BTC to zero by hacking and moving Satoshi coins, thus destroying BTC's narrative completely. 

Tl:dr - Its preposterous to suggest anything like this exists. While it is true that research and development on quantum computers is an ongoing topic, there is no evidence to suggest that such a quantum computing system exists today that can derive BTC private keys from just the addresses."
How I accidentally created a <$100k market cap coin,6876,o25fw4,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o25fw4/how_i_accidentally_created_a_100k_market_cap_coin/,gingercrash,1623957863.0,False,SELF-STORY,t3_o25fw4,False,950,False,0.88,"**Sorry if this is not allowed, I will attempt to keep the name out of this as much as possible to attempt to show this is not a shill but my crazy experience over the last few days and how it changed my viewpoint on crypto. If you are interested in making your token, or just how the under belly of crypto works, then this is for you.**

This is a legitimate, crazy story that has changed my mind on crypto and taught me a lot about the trappings of small cryptos on the DEFI scene, specifically Harmony One's network. This is a long story.

**Where this adventure started**

Strange beginnings for a crypto, but I wanted to know how markets worked, how easy it is to manipulate a price, see how much buys and sells effect crypto. Now I am not rich by any means and didn't want to destroy someone else's project, whether it deserves it or not. So I went looking for a cheap way to build a token and deploy it onto a smart network. I first went to Harmony as it is a project I am really excited for (although this experience may not sound like a glowing reference to Harmony at points, I genuinely still believe Harmony will be a top coin in the future). 

Luckily for me, a token generator exists on the Harmony network (it is called tokenjenny, in no way affiliated). I genuinely do not remember how I found it, but it is likely due to the fact it has a tournament with Viper (what I believe will be the number 1 DEX on Harmony, but I have a small bag so I may be biased). I created a simple token based on what I would want out of a small token, a small hard cap on tokens to, no burns, no sale tax, no airdrops. Just a small token which value held itself against itself without using fancy gimmicks. This was also the best way to change prices.

After a few clicks and a wallet connect, I had all 1 million of my token in my wallet. Ridiculously easy and fee less I believe, with the only cost being the cost of sending the coins to my wallet on Harmony. And there you have it, I own a crypto.

**The self market manipulation**

In the beginning I did not have a clue what I was doing, if I am honest. I thought I did, but once you hold it in your hands and you are responsible, trust me it is different. I immediately dropped 8 ONE (about 50c at the time) against 750k of my tokens into liquidity on Viperswap and I had a live token. From there I proceeded to trade the coin in small amounts until the market cap had gone up to around $20 (this is a guess, it could have been less). I sold some more, then bought back and carried on watching how a big buy vs a small buy sent the price to different levels. And how the DEX actively worked against you buying all the liquidity at once with price impacts. This made it clear to me that this actually works. If people trade it, it will go up. This is obvious, but having full control of the market cap of your coin is again a different feeling. It felt strangely powerful and I wanted to know more.

**The dumb luck**

So I knew the only way to know more was to join a pump and dump group. I arrived at a newly started one on Telegram aimed specifically at Harmony projects. At this point the coin was still a self experiment and I introduced myself to the group awkwardly (I am a very awkward person) and started asking questions. The group were nice and quickly I learnt that I needed to burn my tokens so people trusted me. They even taught me how to do this (twist regarding this later). I decided to go for it. They were complaining about a coin that had just rugged and the owner had too much tokens, so I stacked another 200k of my token into liquidity and sent it to a burner address.

**The social experiment**

So, I decided to explain myself to the chat. My coin was an experiment to me and I decided to be honest about that. That and the fact someone could easily buy the whole supply, I said the truth, I am testing your greed as if you buy too much then you will destroy the token. I thought this would lead to someone going FU and just buying it and me being completely out of all my money, which I was ok with, my experiment would then be complete.

**What actually happened**

People bought little bits, the price rose. It started under 0.00001c which was the lowest value possible on the analytics. After a few hours it had reached 0.00001c. No more > sign. Nice. I thought that would be the end. People were saying how much they liked how I put things, how I encourage selling. I woke up the next morning to it being 0.001c. I realised at this point I was in control of peoples money in a way and therefore I had to be responsible with that. I would hate to be why people lost money down to my experiment.

**Putting the work in**

I opened up a telegram and added people. The prices at certain points gets hazy at this time because it was all so surreal and a major whirlwind. They asked the obvious question, what now? What now indeed. I did not want a pump and dump, I couldn't do that to people. Don't get me wrong at some point I will sell some, but for now I just wanted to make sure I didn't lose people money. I set a price target of 1 token = $1, if not 1 token = 1 One thinking it would be unreachable. The price hit 0.01c. I promised to make a website. I looked into ways to add value. With a coin that does nothing the only value it has is the value that people put to it, so I went looking for ways to add value. It became pretty clear to me that the best use case for the token was to use it in liquidity pools. But how do you get one of those when your coin is still under $1k? I joined the token jenny tournament. A tournament where the 1st placed prize would get you an incentivised pool and a nice cash reward. The price hit 1c. I made a website and set up a tournament to create the logo, paying in my token. The website was to be revealed after the tournament. The price hit 6c. My token had a market cap of $60k in the space of a week from creation. 8 One had turned into a value of 1 million One in the space of a week. It rose to 8c.

**The dump**

I woke up the next morning and the price was 4c. Ouch. My worst fears had happened. It had battled against it but that was it, the end. Or so I thought. People asked what happened and to get people interested I went shilling. Not to pump and dump, but to get new customers. Not all the dump was people selling all, they were just taking profits, good. I had said from the beginning, you sell when you need to, no one knows your story and what that amount of money will do to you. People liked my response. It battled to 10c but dropped again.

**The copycat**

Someone released a coin called 1 billion. It was a reference to my name and advertised it as homage. It was a memecoin standard, where there were burns, tax and no proof of liquidity burn. I found it a compliment. People were annoyed that I didn't get annoyed, but I genuinely thought it would be good for my coin.

**100k Market cap**

This weekend was meant to be my wedding anniversary and nephews 1st birthday. I spent all weekend keeping people active. Growing bonds with people and advertising the competition. The competition happened and the response was immense. Immediately I added the winning logo to the website and shared the site. I expected to wake up back at 1c with the hype dying and having to talk down people wanting free crypto. I had made the mistake of paying people who did not win too as I liked their submission. Big mistake. 

I woke up with the price at 9c. As soon as I was active again it was at 14c.

**Jealousy/FUD**

So I had started noticing that certain people were saying not so nice things about my token and me. The main one being the rug pull. Easy to get rid of with proof of liquidity sent to dead address. This did not stop it. Then it was that I will print more. I showed the contract, hard cap 1 million tokens. They created a telegram group to do group research into new tokens. Fine by me, it is needed. 1st post, my token is on their watch list. I lost my rag. I didn't understand what their problem was. I should have stayed out of it, but it was other people's money in my hands. It felt personal. I managed to bat back every FUD except the fact there could be whales, I couldn't argue that, there were 2 or 3. It was inevitable. 

Then I went onto viperswap tradeable coins on Coingecko and realised my coin was the only Harmony coin with a green trust score. They soon gave up. They were the creators behind 1 Billion or in the circle. 1 Billion got rug pulled. I came out shining. The price stayed stable.

**The tournament**

We flew into second place and have stayed there since. The leading coin is probably out of reach, and they know the tournament creator and viper devs. It feels like they were meant to win. I hope I am wrong.

**The hype dies down**

So this is now getting to present day. Big buyers become smaller sellers, but still selling. We sit at a still very respectable 6 to 7c. I have plans, and will soon start approaching other DEX's for liquidity pools as I now fully understand our value in a pool. Being none deflationary nor inflationary, our value would hold a coin up very nicely. I have to learn social media marketing too, but I will get this coin on a DEX and in a pool. I have to.

**What I learnt and how it changed my view on crypto**

I genuinely thought that it would get bought immediately and I would be dumped off. I was genuinely ok with that. But I learnt that people just want a chance at a better life and crypto gives them hope. Some make it. Some don't. 1 Billion pumped and rugged so hard I had people apologising to me that they had to sell mine to cover losses there. I always said I understood and I did to a certain degree, at least enough to know it wasn't an act against my token.

The DEX market is really a shit show beneath the hood. Dodgy analytics that lose connection making people think you have rugged (I have been told this is down to Harmony One issues at the moment, which I am inclined to believe). People trying to scam as many people as possible. Harmony was a nice place, but as more comes along the more it becomes like any other. Copies of copies popping up everywhere. It is good, but I wish I could get the message out to everyone, do not dip into it with money you can't afford to lose, even money you don't want to lose. You will lose 9 out of 10 times. There are geniuses in the early days, but they are heavily outnumbered by scammers. It is a shame, but it is inevitable with full decentralisation.

Token value is set by greed rather than worth. A coin with green candles will outsell a coin with red candle any day of the week. People forget the saying sell when there is greed and buy when there is fear so quickly due to FOMO. It is terrifying and something I am going to start drilling into my kids ASAP.

Analytics are easily scuffed, especially at low level crypto. I learnt this myself but also watching other coins in the tournament. Do not fall for green candles, please.

Honesty can win, I was honest from the beginning, I will stay honest. Our little success is testament to this. It pushes me and the community to put more work in and make a genuine project. I know we will get there.

Being responsible for peoples money is scary. Never will I ever trust anyone again who outright fully enjoys this. I thought it would be fun making money for people, but genuinely it has been terrifying, dizzying and has caused so much anxiety. This is why I have to make this work going forward.

Thank you for reading this far down and not deleting it if it doesn't get deleted, I thought I would just tell my story, a story I will never forget no matter what. I couldn't it has changed me."

The Doge pump last week angered me and you could see people getting excited and the inevitable was going to happen. A lot of new people got sucked into the prospect of quick, easy money and calls for calm fell on deaf ears.

Then the same with XRP. I had friends calling me about it and asking advice and I told them exactly what I thought was going on, which transpired to be the case.  Lucky they took my advice and held off. 

There’s been a significant rise in new accounts shilling these days and it’s our responsibility to help ease new investors into the space. It’s frustrating watching the endless shill.

"Real, mainstream crypto adoption is happening right now. You just haven't realized.",6847,nobj1h,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nobj1h/real_mainstream_crypto_adoption_is_happening/,AlexxLopaztico02,1622382345.0,False,FINANCE,t3_nobj1h,False,847,False,0.92,"Yes, that's quite the title, I know. But after seeing the hundredth post on the frontpage talking about altcoins that have real use cases, I can't stop thinking about this one.

You all know Venezuela, right? The country with space-high inflation rates, the one that /r/cryptocurrency says crypto adoption is feasible. 

Well, it's finally really happening.

I'm Venezuelan, so let me explain some weird things about our economy. First, prices double every 3 months. Second, we don't have access to USD bank accounts in the country. And third, physical cash is scarce: Bolivares because you need a lot of them to pay for little, and USD because the ""dollarization"" isn't official, small change simply doesn't exist (coins, for example). This creates the perfect variables for digital, exact payment. This is where the Reserve Protocol comes in.

We have been using some digital payments app since a while ago, apps like Zelle, PayPal or Transferwise. The problem with those apps is that they often close accounts in Venezuela to avoid problems with the US government. Simply put, those companies just didn't want to deal with the problem that is Venezuela related legislation.

Enter [Reserve.](https://reserve.org/) The team at Reserve created a stablecoin alongside an easy to use app for mainstream use. The app allows people to deposit Bolivares (the local currency) from their bank account and instantly exchange them for dollars (RSV stablecoins!). You might be thinking, well, that isn't that big of a deal, is it? Thing is, it is. Venezuelans can't just exchange Bolívares to USD legally because there aren't any bank accounts in USD inside Venezuela. The only way to save in USD would be to open an account in Panamá or risk your money getting lost in Zelle or PayPal. The app allows people to send RSV, pay with RSV, receive any crypto and convert it to RSV or Bolivares and so on. Reserve is literally saving people from hyperinflation.

Well, why do I say mainstream crypto adoption is happening? Because people aren't paying in bolivares anymore. It is estimated that in 2020, 55% of transactions were made in foreign currency, and that number just keeps growing everyday. Now, the great part.

**The Reserve app has more than 100k downloads.** **People are using** **crypto, not as a way to invest, not as a store of value, but as it was intended: a currency.**  And it's happening right in front of us, but we're too worried about the price going up or down so much that we missed the real reason crypto is here: to serve as a currency when fiat fails us. In my case, fiat failed me. And crypto, for me and many more, is the way."
This is why adoption and the US is so behind when it comes to Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency. Have a look at this shocking video from Congress.,6810,bm4ppj,https://v.redd.it/6mize9uuezw21,dinono33,1557318820.0,False,COMEDY,t3_bm4ppj,False,703,False,0.92,

Because that's the trick.  The trick to a 401K is to get everyone to hold because if everyone sells, then everyone else who didn't sell fast enough will lose money and the whole thing will crash.    That's why they charge penalities.    

It's like investing in safemoon and they charge you penalities for selling In order to keep the current value more stable so the entirety of holders don't start panic selling it into oblivion.

Also you can panic sell a 401K too.  It happened to many people after the housing market crash of 2008.    My mom panic sold her 401k because it went from $50K to $9K ...I didn't know much about investing back then, but I will never forget what she said.  *I was afraid I would lose it all, it kept going down* 

What she said sounds much like what people say about Bitcoin today. 

Nowadays my mom is retired, and sometimes she brings that up...*I should've just kept it in...it went back up*

Unfortunately this is how the most powerful people work.  They shake out weak hands so they can buy up super low.   Otherwise there would be no big guy buying your shit back.  

Rich are buying your shit cheap for a reason...not just because they are just speculating. 


So yeah, you can get serious FUD with 401K and it's not just coming from my mom. Many honest hard working people don't understand the game whales play...they get shilled into things and are convinced it's safe because their employer offers it.    All a 401K is, is investments into stocks and bonds that are stable but not always safe. 

So if you can continually dump every paycheck into something that penalizes you for withdrawing early and hold that shit for 30 years , then you can buy Bitcoin  once and hold it for 3 years without any penality for withdrawing some too early unless tax on capital gains. But that's normal. 

So stick to your original plan, and hold."

I used to be a student 10 years ago. Now I have a decent job. 
I can't help but think in which mindset are students who lately made some quick gains. If you did take some gains, I can only congratulate you, you probably did better than most of your student peers who are probably not fully aware of what crypto is.

But be aware that once you make your first gains, there is something I call the ""casino effect"". It pushes you to take more and more risks. I think it can be even amplified as a student because most of you don't have yet a monthly income. I remember that each penny counts and insane gains can start turning your head. At the same time, you are in the period of your life when you need to make very important decisions.

Lately, you might read about young Samsung employees quitting their jobs in South Korea thanks to millions of $ they earned in crypto. Or read cool posts about huge gains and lambo.
And you might think there is no good reason to study anymore.
Strangely there is not much about people ashamed of massive losses.

My message is for you to keep in mind you must measure your risk. Crypto is great but who knows when the rollercoaster ends or when you will make bad moves (we all do). You can not rely only on that. Hopefully the recent dip made you realize that. Please treat your study as your top priority and crypto as a bonus. If you make it in crypto, that would be amazing. If not, you still have a diploma and a good option in life.

- Crypto = great
- Crypto + job = better

Don't gamble on your life. Don't have regrets. Decision is only yours.

Your crypto older brother who wish you good in life."

But the reality is the only reason the value of a currency goes up is due the brave people who take the risk to buy in at the riskiest points in the market.

If these people didn't exist cryptocurrency would never have taken off the ground. And those of us who have accrued life changing monetary value in this market have these people to thanks.

They are the heroes we need, but they are not the ones most of the market deserves.

To the brave people who buy at the market top, we salute you, and i pledge to do my best not to let your investment lose too much value in the short term so we can all come out on top on the long term.

Thank you and good night."

**Edit 3: Version 2.0 is below. Thanks for everyone's feedback.**

Changes:

1. Certain coins are easier to see
2. Some categories moved for less confusion, e.g. privacy coins are now under currency along with stablecoins.
3. Icons have been added for ERC20, BEP2/BEP20, and Forks
4. Some descriptions changed slightly for accuracies
5. Some typos fixed (e.g. USDC instead of CSDC)
6. Stellar moved out of the distributed computing category as it doens't offer an on-chain programming language or on-chain smart contracts, it now bridges the currency and finance categories.

1. Certain coins hard to find/unclear
2. I didn't intend for privacy coins to look like it was a subset of store of value, however it looks like people are interpreting it that way. I am going to move it under currency and change a few things round so similar categories are grouped together.
3. Thinking of adding icons next to coins indicating additional properties of that coin, e.g. ERC20 token, BSC20 token, Fork of bitcoin
4. Description of DeFi section is off, because some of the projects are centralised, so am changing it to just 'financial services'
5. Various small typos/capital letter inconsistencies.
6. Changing Stellar/XLM to just currency, and possibly make it part of the DeFi group, as the smart contracts are not executed on chain, and so it can't really be considered distributed computing.

Good work Binance 👌

Edit - I'm not a shill (except maybe for Ripple). I have just been really impressed with how binance have handled situations like this. It's a fresh breath of air when you look at all the other shit going down in the crypto world.

Many of us have fallen for this in 2017, buying and selling shitcoins on a daily basis, being eaten up by fees, but we were still up at the end of the day thanks to the bull run. But we would’ve made more money if we just hodled our coins and not traded at all.

"When every crash is a ""dip"" and every bounce is a ""we have liftoff"" -- that's how a frog gets boiled to death. 2017 Crumbs of Wisdom thread for Bull Runs.",6315,m2lky8,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m2lky8/when_every_crash_is_a_dip_and_every_bounce_is_a/,IfByLand,1615451493.0,False,TRADING,t3_m2lky8,False,1223,False,0.9,"Like many of you, I got burned by hodling too long through 2017/2018. ""Hodl"" is a stupid meme for newbs. I learned the hard way.

So called ""fundamentals"" ('solid team', 'awesome project', 'upcoming partnerships')  don't reflect the price in a company that received its funding before it has ever proven anything (that's the primary difference between an ICO and an IPO). ***Where my REQ marines at?***

When this bull run is actually over (and personally i don't believe that it is yet), you probably won't come to accept it until your portfolio is sitting at 50% of its ATH and your ""stack"" of crypto has become a ""bag"" you're stuck holding ""until you reach XX number again--then you'll sell *for sure*.""

Here's the reality: Once the bubble pops, every crash is going to seem like a ""dip"" and every ""bounce"" is going feel like a ""this is gentlemen.""  ***That's how frogs get boiled to death.***

Here are some principles you need to keep in mind if you want to walk away from this bull run with a fat stack of cash:

1. Recognize and accept that you won't sell the exact top, and that--subsequently--your portfolio's ""true value"" is only what you sell it for--not what it's ATH was at one point.
2. Pick a realistic sum (take your dream figure and subtract 50%) at which you're going to cash out a certain percentage--or all of it--and (here's the important part): ***STICK TO IT.***
   1. This latter point is most crucial, because as the sum grows and actually hits that number you picked, you're going to be very tempted to leave it in ""just a little longer"". That's greed talking. If you ask Greed ""how much is enough?"" the answer is always ""a little bit more."" Have discipline in this and you'll win. Let greed take over and you'll lose. *If you let greed govern your decisions in a bull market, then you'll let panic govern your decisions in a bear market.*
3. You can't predict the future--so don't judge your past self for knowledge you have today. ""Why didn't i buy that coin?!?! it just mooned!"" Or ""Why didn't i sell before it crashed?!"" You know what happened yesterday because it's today--you can't get mad at yourself for not possessing today's knowledge on the day before yesterday.
4. My final and **MOST IMPORTANT** point:
   1. As I said before ***your portfolio is only worth what you actually sell it for***. So do **NOT** focus on ***how much it was*** or ***how much it could have been*** \-- if you make this mistake you will be dissatisfied at turning $1000 into $100,000. If you've only got a $1,000 right now, you're probably thinking ""of course i'd be happy with $100k!"" -- but when you get there you'll be holding out for 200/300/1 million. In your greed, you won't be satisfied with an enormous return--especially if you keep thinking about how you could have had $1,000,000 if you just ""bought that dip"" that no one saw coming or ""held xyz coin"" a little bit longer.  ***Focus on what you have today--not what you might have tomorrow.***

The ultimate guide to earning passive income with cryptocurrencies 📌,6283,lk2rtw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lk2rtw/the_ultimate_guide_to_earning_passive_income_with/,Weaver96,1613353568.0,False,EDUCATIONAL,t3_lk2rtw,False,1379,False,0.85,"Most of us are here to make money. Some people try trading, while others just HODL and check the prices every 5 minutes. And even though many of us have made decent amounts, neither of these two ways can guarantee a reliable source of income.

But what if I told you that apart from trading and holding, there are other ways that can make you money in the crypto space? Well, in this guide I have collected most of these methods so that you can pick out the ones you prefer, and start earning passive income with crypto.

# #1 - Staking

Staking is an activity where a user locks or holds his funds in a cryptocurrency wallet to participate in maintaining the operations of a proof-of-stake (PoS)-based blockchain system. It is similar to crypto mining in the sense that it helps a network achieve consensus while rewarding users who participate.

Staking can be an excellent way to increase your cryptocurrency holdings with minimal effort. You can stake various cryptocurrencies such as DOT, ADA, AVAX etc. By doing this, you earn a certain APY (annual percentage yield), usually between 4%-25% depending on how long you are willing to lock your cryptos.

You can either stake a coin from a wallet such as Exodus, or you can stake your coins on a few exchanges (e.g. Binance). As always, DYOR before locking your crypto for 30-60-90 or more days.

# #2 - Airdrops

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. Small amounts of the new virtual currency are sent to the wallets of active members of the blockchain community for free or in return for a small service, such as retweeting a post sent by the company issuing the currency.

The famous Uniswap airdrop made 49 million UNI claimable for users whose address has ever called the Uniswap v1 or v2 contracts. Each address could claim 400 UNI (worth ≈ $7400), which is a nice sum for doing almost nothing.

It is worth keeping an eye out for possible future airdrops, so make sure to follow the news! :)

# #3 - Reddit Moons

Most of the users here already know, but for those who don't (and with a large influx of new members, it's possibly a lot of you guys), you can earn Moons for upvotes on this subreddit. But what are Moons?

""Moons exist as ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain, where they are managed by a suite of smart contracts that handle balances, transfers, distribution/claiming, and purchasing Special Memberships. The smart contracts and mobile apps have been reviewed and audited by Trail of Bits, an independent security firm with blockchain expertise.

As blockchain tokens, Moons are independent of Reddit. Once you’ve earned them, neither Reddit nor moderators can take your Moons away or decide what you do with them. They’re all yours.""

In order to be able to claim your Moons, you'll need to download the Reddit mobile app and set up your vault (click on your icon at the top left of the home page).

The main purpose for moons is to own a share of the community (vote on governance/distribution proposals) as well as redeem them for the premium membership, which allows you to change the color of your username, embed gifs in comments, add custom flair, etc.

To sum it up, you earn Moons by commenting and posting - something that you'd normally do anyway. Just don't forget to create your vault!

In case you want to, you have the option to sell your Moons. The current price of Moons is $0.071380 / coin (15/02/2021), and you can only sell your moons on Honeyswap at the moment.

# #4 - Nexo, Celsius, etc.

This method is very similar to what banks offer on your investment, except that on Nexo and Celsius you can earn up to 6-14% just by keeping your crypto, stablecoin or fiat on their site.

While the saying ""not your keys, not your coins"" is true, these companies are insured and have never been hacked before. As far as I know, both of these sites have a daily payout system, and you can deposit and withdraw funds whenever you want to.

If you choose this method, it might be worth splitting your investment between these sites in order to prepare for the worst and also to be able to claim offers and bonuses on both sites once available.

# #5 - Coinbase Earn

Not a ""passive"" method, but I felt like I should add this one to the list. Many of you are already familiar with the ""It ain't much, but it's honest work"" meme referring to Coinbase Earn, a program where you can earn a few coins by watching educational videos of certain cryptocurrencies and solving the quizzes that follow said videos.

In my country, currently Graph, Compound, XLM, CELO, Band, and Maker are available through Coinbase Earn, and if you complete all of these crypto's quizzes, you can earn up to $30-$40. In crypto, of course.

Compared to the previous methods, it truly ain't much, but it's honest work, and who knows how these coins will perform in the upcoming years. Worth a shot!

Investing in Crypto with Low Income: How I've been doing it,6170,m983wv,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m983wv/investing_in_crypto_with_low_income_how_ive_been/,Siamak71,1616250480.0,False,STRATEGY,t3_m983wv,False,687,False,0.95,"I'm from a 3rd world country with a very unstable economy and hyper inflated currency. I got into cryptocurrency at the beginning of COVID because I lost my job and there were no other jobs available, so I did some research and saw how fiat and will of governments are the major reason my people suffer this much and also how crypto can help bypass these restrictions.

So, after doing research and calculating electricity costs and gains, I invested most of my savings into a small mining rig which ended up earning me more money per month than my previous job because the price of ETH got better. For reference I was making 110$ per month from my job, but I was earning roughly 160$ from mining every month. I found another job recently, but for quite some time, mining was my primary source of income. Now I roughly earn 300$ per month, mining + my job.

Anyway the reason I brought this up was to show how little I was earning and how I still managed to invest in crypto. Usually investing requires a large amount of initial capital (Such as stocks and property), which many people don't have, but crypto doesn't have any such barrier. I started spending less and less on things I didn't really need. Smoking, drinking, occasional drug use (marijuana) and ordering food all the time. These can be anything, for me it was these things. Some people spend excessive money on collectible, games, clothing etc... So its up to each individual to find out what is their needless spending.

I quit smoking, drugs and alcohol and started cooking more. This allowed me to invest around 1$ per day in BTC or coin of my choice. Sometimes I simply held onto my ETH instead of selling it, and sometimes I bought another coin. But as I said, it was around 30$ a month. It's basically nothing in terms of international value, but it was decent amount of money for me (inflation is a bitch) and now depending on the coin I invested in, I have profits in almost all of them. Even though I convert most of my mining into fiat to spend on bills and costs of living, every investment I made I've been hodling ever since. It didn't make me rich or anything, but now I have basically tripled my investments and have more in savings than I ever did.

Which one are you more likely to regret more:

1. I could have spent the whole year smoking and drinking, and eating bad food, but I didn't
2. I could have spent the whole year investing in crypto and living a healthier life, but I didn't

In fact, with my savings, I would feel less terrible for indulging in things I quit now and then, because its no longer a big economic drain like it used to be and we are all human, so we do deserve some leisure spending. Its all thanks to that crucial year of investing.

I recommend everyone to do their own research, but I still believe it's early enough to invest a small amount of your income in crypto every month, hodl and see profits long term. My mother thinks I am some kind of genius for tripling our savings, but she simply doesn't understand the concept of crypto. In reality, I was just following crypto info on my 2nd monitor while gaming and not spending money on things I didn't need. I am no genius. Crypto simply provides investment opportunities to people who don't have large initial capital to invest in traditional investment avenues.

I hope this has been helpful to other people with low income, specially others who are also from countries that have unstable economy and inflated currencies. Even 1%-5% of your monthly income in crypto is a good long term investment, but as always do your own research and pick your coins. I didn't do ""day trading"" or try to invest in new coins, hoping they would go up. I mainly invested in coins that were solid already. I would suggest the same for fellow low income investors. In the end this has been my experience, and I thought I should share it. And don't forget, this is just for one year. The more we hold, the better. Finally, even if we don't make it, we have merely sacrificed unnecessary things in our lives, we still have the friends and connections we made along the way.

P.S: Happy new year and Nowruz to everyone who follow Iranian/Zoroastrian solar calendar around the world! The equinox is upon us and spring has sprung! Happy first day of spring.

Edit: Thanks a lot for all the rewards and support! I would love to message each one of you to thank you individually, but there is so many of you! Thank you very much for all the support."

[The idiocy of newbies FOMO-ing into anything with low nominal value lead to endless twitter timelines like this](https://i.imgur.com/zDjmRjl.jpg), and now nobody has any idea where the market settles. What do you do now? 

In the following weeks it will be a good time to rethink your investment approach and how you arrive at your decisions. Just buying whatever is shilled on Twitter or Reddit and jumping from one crypto to another isn't going to work like it did these last two months. 

The good news is that we're finally back closer and closer to our long term moving average which is much more healthy for entrants, the bad news is that the fear might continue compounding if outstanding issues are not dealt with. [Tether is the big concern for me personally for reasons I've stated many times](https://np.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7tg8fn/tether_drama_tether_has_dissolved_relationship/dtco50g/), but some relief in the short term may come if the SEC and CFTC meeting on February 6th goes well. Nobody really knows where the bottom is but I think we're now past the ""irrational exhuberance"" stage and we're entering a period of more serious inspection where cryptos will actually have to prove themselves as useful. I suspect hype artists like CryptoNick and John McAfee will fall out of favor.

But perhaps most importantly use this as a learning experience, don't try to point fingers now. The type of dumb behavior that people were engaging in that was rewarded in a bull market (chasing pumps, going all in on a shillcoin, following hype..etc) could only ever lead to what we are experiencing now. Just like so many people jumped on the crypto bandwagon during the bull run, they will just as quickly jump on whatever bandwagon is to be used to blame for the deflation of the bubble. Nobody who pumped money into garbage without any use case will accept that they themselves with their own investing behavior were the real reason for the gross overvaluation of most cryptocurrencies, and the inevitable crash.

So if you're looking for a fresh start after the massacre (or just want to get in now), here is a guide:

#Part A: Making a Investment Strategy
---------------------------

This is your money, put some effort into investing it with an actual strategy. Some simple yet essential advice that should apply to everyone, regardless of individual strategy:

1. Slow down and research each crypto that you're buying for at least a week.

2. Don't buy something just because it has risen.

3. Don't exit a position just because it has declined.

4. Invest only as much as you can afford to lose.

5. Prepare enter and exit strategies in advance. 

First take some time to think about your ROI target, set your hold periods for each position and how much you are actually ready to risk losing.

**ROI targets**

A lot of young investors who are in crypto have unrealistic expectations about returns and risk. A lot of them have never invested in any other type of financial asset, and hence many seem to consider a 5-10% ROI in a month to be unexciting. 

But its important to temper your hype and realize why we had this exponential growth in the last year and how unlikely it is that we see 10x returns in the next year. What we saw recently was [Greater Fool Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greater_fool_theory) in action. Those unexciting returns of 5-10% a month are much more of the norm, and much more healthy for an alternative investment class. 

You can think about setting a target in terms of the market ROI over a relevant holding period and then add or decrease based on your own risk profile.

**Example: Calculating a 2 year ROI target**

Lets say you want to hold for 2 years now, how could you set a realistic target to strive for? You could look at a historical 2 year return as a base, preferably during a period similar to what we're facing now. Now that we had a major correction, I think we can look at the two year period starting in 2015 after we had the 2014 crash. To calculate a 2 year CAGR starting in 2015:

Year  | Total Crypto Market Cap 
-------|------
Jan 1, 2015:|  $5.5 billion 
Jan 1, 2017:  | $18 billion

Compounded annual growth return (CAGR):  [(18/5.5)^(1/2)]-1 = 81%

This annual return rate of 81% comes out to about 4.9% compounded monthly. This may not sound exciting to the lambo moon crowd, but it will keep you grounded in reality. You can aim for a higher return (say 2x of that 81% rate) if you choose to take on more risky propositions. I can't tell you what return target you should set for yourself, but just make sure its not depended on you needing to achieve continual near vertical parabolic price action in small cap shillcoins because that isn't sustainable. 

Once you have a target you can construct your risk profile (low risk vs. high risk category coins) in your portfolio based on your target.

**Risk Management**

Everything you buy in crypto is risky, but it still helps to think of these 3 risk categories:

* Core holdings - This is the exchange pairing cryptos and those that are well established. These are almost sure to be around in 5 years, and will recover after any bear market. The Coinbase pairs (Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ethereum) are in this class of risk, and I would also argue Monero.

* Medium Risk Speculative - These would be cryptos which generally have a working product and niche, but higher risk than Core. Things like ZCash and Ripple, relatively established history but still uncertainty over long term viability.

* High Risk Speculative - This is anything created within the last few months, ICOs, low caps, shillcoins...etc. Most cryptos are in this category.

How much risk should you take on? That depends on your own life situation for one, but also it should be proportional to how much expertise you have in both financial analysis and technology. 

The general starting point I would recommend is: 

* 50-70% for newbies in Low Risk Core, then you can go down to 30% as you gains confidence and experience

* Always try to keep at least a 1/3rd in safe core positions

* Don't go all in on speculative picks.

Some more core principles on risk management to consider:

* Diversify across sectors and rebalance your allocations periodically. 

* Consider using dollar cost averaging to enter a position. This generally means investing a X amount over several periods, instead of at once. You can also use downward biased dollar cost averaging to mitigate against downward risk. For example instead of investing $1000 at once in a position at market price, you can buy $500 at the market price today then set several limit orders at slightly lower intervals (for example $250 at 5% lower than market price, $250 at 10% lower than market price). This way your average cost of acquisition will be lower if the crypto happens to decline over the short term.

* Don't have more than 5-10% of your net worth in crypto.

* Have the majority of your holdings in things you feel good holding for at least 2 years. Don't use the majority of your investment for day trading or short term investing.

* Remember you didn't actually make any money until you take some profits, so take do some profits when everyone else is at peak FOMO-ing mode.

* Have some fiat in reserve at a FDIC-insured exchange (ex. Gemini), and be ready to add to your winning positions on a pullback. This should be part of your entry strategy.

* Consider what level of loss you can't accept in a position with a high risk factor, and use stop-limit orders to hedge against sudden crashes. Set you stop price at about 5-10% above your lowest limit. Stop-limit orders aren't perfect but they're better than having no hedging strategy for a risky microcap in case of some meltdown. Only you can determine what bags you are unwilling to hold.


You can think of each crypto having a risk factor that is the summation of the general crypto market risk (Rm), but also its own inherent risk specific to its own goals (Ri).

Rt = Rm +Ri

The market risk is something you cannot avoid, it is essentially the risk that is carried by the entire market over things like regulations. What you can minimize though the Ri, the specific risks with your crypto. That will depend on the team composition, geographic risks (for example Chinese coins like NEO carry regulatory risks specific to China), competition within the space and likelihood of adoption and other factors, which I'll describe in Part 2: Crypto Picking Methodology.


**Portfolio Allocation**

Along with thinking about your portfolio in terms of risk categories described above, I really find it helpful to think about the segments you are in. [OnChainFX](http://onchainfx.com/) has some segment categorization but I generally like to bring it down to:

* Core holdings - BTC, Ethereum, LTC...etc

* Platform segment - Ethereum, NEO, Ark...etc

* Privacy segment - Monero, Zcash, PivX..etc

* Finance/Bank settlement segment - Ripple, Stellar...etc

* Enterprise Blockchain solutions segment - VeChain, Walton, Factom...etc

* Promising Tech segment - NANO/Raiblock, Cardano...etc

Think about your [""Circle of Competence""](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Circle_of_competence), your body of knowledge that allows you to evaluate an investment. Your ability to properly judge risk and potential is going to largely correlated to your understanding of the subject matter. If you don't know anything about how supply chains functions, how can you competently judge whether VeChain or WaltonChain will achieve adoption? If you don't understand anything about the tech when you read the Cardano paper, are you really able to determine how likely it is to be adopted?

Consider the [historic correlations between your holdings](https://cointrading.ninja/correlation). Generally when Bitcoin pumps, altcoins dump but at what rate depends on the coin. When Bitcoin goes sideways we tend to see pumping in altcoins, while when Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. 

You should diversify but really shouldn't be in much more than around 12 cryptos, because you simply don't have enough competency to accurately access the risk across every segment and for every type of crypto you come across. If you have over 20 different cryptos in your portfolio you should probably think about consolidating to a few sectors you understand well. 


#Part B: Crypto Picking Methodology (Due Dilligence)
------------------------------------------

Do you struggle on how to fundamentally analyze cryptocurrencies? Here is a 3-step methodology to follow to perform your due dilligence:

# Step 1: Filtering and Research

There is so much out there that you can get overwhelmed. The best way to start is to think back to your own portfolio allocation strategy and what you would like to get more off. For example in my view enterprise-focused blockchain solutions will be important in the next few years, and so I look to create a list of various cryptos that are in that segment.

[Upfolio has brief descriptions of the top 100 cryptos and is filterable by categories](https://www.upfolio.com/100-coins-explained), for example you can click the ""Enterprise"" category and you have a neat list of VEN, FCT, WTC...etc.

Once you have a list of potential candidates, its time to read about them:

* Critically evaluate the website. If it's a cocktail of nonsensical buzzwords, if its unprofessional and poorly made, stay away. Always look for a roadmap, compare to what was actually delivered so far. Always check the team, try to find them on LinkedIn and what they did in the past. 

* Read the whitepaper or business development plan. You should fully understand how this crypto functions and how its trying to create value. If there is no use case or if the use case does not require or benefit from a blockchain, move on. 

* Check the blockchain explorer. How is the token distribution across accounts? Are the big accounts selling? Try to figure out who the whales are (not always easy!) and what the foundation/founder account is based on the initial allocation.

* Look at the Github repos, does it look empty or is there plenty of activity?

* Search out the subreddit and look at a few Medium or Steem blogs about the coin. How ""shilly"" is the community, and how much engagement is there between developer and the community?

* I would also go through the BitcoinTalk thread and Twitter mentions, judge both the length and quality of the discussion.

You can actually filter out a lot of scams and bad investments by simply keeping your eye out on the following red flags:

* allocations that give way too much to the founder

* guaranteed promises of returns (Bitcooonnneeeect!)

* vague whitepapers filled with buzzwords

* vague timelines and no clear use case

* Github with no useful code and sparse activity

* a team that is difficult to find information on 

#Step 2: Passing a potential pick through a checklist

Once you feel fairly confident that a pick is worth analyzing further, run them through a standardized checklist of questions. This is one I use, you can add other questions yourself:

Crypto Analysis Checklist |
---------|
What is the problem or transactional inefficiency the coin is trying to solve? |
What is the Dev Team like? What is their track record? How are they funded, organized? |
How big is the market they're targeting? |
Who is their competition and what does it do better? |
What is the roadmap they created and how well have they kept to it? |
What current product exists? |
How does the token/coin actually derive value for the holder? Is there a staking mechanism or is it transactional? |
Is there any new tech, and is it informational or governance based? |
Can it be easily copied? |
What are the weaknesses or problems with this crypto?  |

The last question is the most important. 

This is where the riskiness of your crypto is evaluated, the Ri I talked about above. Here you should be able to accurate place the crypto into one of the three risk categories. I also like to run through this checklist of blockchain benefits and consider which specific properties of the blockchain are being used by the specific crypto to provide some increased utility over the current transactional method:

Benefits of Cryptocurrency |
---------|
Decentralization - no need for a third party to agree or validate transactions. |
Transparency and trust - As blockchain are shared, everyone can see what transactions occur. Useful for something like an online casino. |
Immutability - It is extremely difficult to change a transaction once its been put onto a blockchain |
Distributed availability - The system is spread on thousands of nodes on a P2P network, so its difficult to take the system down. |
Security - cryptographically secured transactions provide integrity |
Simplification and consolidation - a blockchain can serve as a shared ledger in industries where multiple entities previously kept their own data sources |
Quicker Settlement - In the financial industry when we're dealing with post-trade settlement, a blockchain can drastically increase the speed of verification |
Cost - in some cases avoiding a third party verification would drastically reduce costs. |


#Step 3: Create a valuation model

You don't need to get into full modeling or have a financial background. Even a simple model that just tries to derive a valuation through relative terms will put you above most crypto investors. Some simple valuation methods that anyone can do:

**Probablistic Scenario Valuation**

This is all about thinking of scenarios and probability, a helpful exercise in itself. For example: Bill Miller, a prominent value investor, [wrote a probabilistic valuation case for Bitcoin in 2015](http://dev.lmminvestments.com/a-value-investors-case-for-bitcoin/). He looked at two possible scenarios for probabalistic valuation:

1. becoming a store-of-value equal to gold (a $6.4 trillion value), with a .25% probability of occurring
2.  replacing payment processors like VISA, MasterCard, etc. (a $350 million dollar value) with a 2.5% probability

Combining those scenarios would give you the total expected market cap: (0.25% x 6.4 trillion) + (2.5% x 350 million). Divide this by the outstanding supply and you have your valuation.


**Metcalfe's Law**

[Metcalfe's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metcalfe's_law) which states that the value of a network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system (n^2). So you can compare various currencies based on their market cap and square of active users or traffic. We can alter this to crypto by thinking about it in terms of both users and transactions:

For example, compare the Coinbase pairs:

Metric | Bitoin | Ethereum  | Litecoin
---------|----------|----------|----------
Market Cap | $152 Billion | $93 Billion | $7.3 Billion
Daily Transactions (last 24hrs) | 249,851| 1,051,427 | 70,397
Active Addresses (Peak 1Yr) | 1,132,000 |1,035,000 | 514,000
Metcalfe Ratio (Transactions Based)| 2.43 | 0.08 | 1.47
Metcalfe Ratio (Address Based)| 0.12| 0.09 | 0.03

Generally the higher the ratio, the higher the valuation given for each address/transaction.

**Market Cap to Industry comparisons**

Another easy one is simply looking at the total market for the industry that the coin is supposedly targeting and comparing it to the market cap of the coin. Think of the market cap not only with circulating supply like its shown on CMC but including total supply. For example the total supply for Dentacoin is 1,841,395,638,392, and when multiplied by its price in early January we get a market cap that is actually higher than the entire industry it aims to disrupt: Dentistry. 

**More complex valuation models**

If you would like to get into more fleshed out models with Excel, I highly recommend Chris Burniske's blog about using Quantity Theory of Money to build an [equivalent of a DCF analysis for crypto](https://medium.com/@cburniske).

[Here is an Excel file example of OMG done by Nodar Janashia using Chris' model ](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FvYGe0TA-rZR00iAV2PDI-B9zba6GpEG1FodECWJDys/edit). 

You should create multiple scenarios with multiple assumptions, both positive and negative. Have a base scenario and then moderately optimistic/pessimistic and highly optimistic/pessimistic scenario.

Personally I like to see at least a 50% upward potential before investing from my moderately pessimistic scenario, but you can set your own safety margin.

The real beneficial thing about modelling isn't even the price or valuation comparisons it spits out, but that it forces you to think about why the coin has value and what your own assumption about the future are. For example the discount rate you apply to the net present utility formula drastically affects the valuation, and it reflects your own assumptions of how risky the crypto is. What exactly would be a reasonable discount rate? What about the digital economy you are assuming for the coin, what levers affects its size and adoption and how likely are your assumptions to come true? You'll be a drastically more intelligent investor if you think about the fundamental variables that give your coin the market cap you think it should hold.


#Summing it up
------------------------------------------

The time for lambo psychosis is over. But that's no reason to feel down, this is a new day and what many were waiting for. I've put together in one place here how to construct a portfolio allocation (taking into consideration risk and return targets), and how to go through a systematic crypto picking method. I'm won't tell you what to buy, you should always decide that for yourself and DYOR. But as long as you follow a rational and thorough methodology (feel free to modify anything I said above to suit your own needs) you will feel pretty good about your investments, even in times like these.

We’ll be answering your questions for a duration of **3 hours (April 28 2021, 7AM PST - 10AM PST (10PM to 1AM UTC+8)**, so don’t hesitate to ask any questions now and live during the session and we’ll answer them as best as we can!

**We've also just launched** [**a brand new 1 Million USD Grant Program**](https://medium.com/vechain-foundation/announcing-one-million-usd-grant-program-for-the-vechain-enft-ecosystem-7e2e6eea02e2) **for developers to build their NFT, DeFi, Gaming, etc projects on VeChain to kickstart our eNFT ecosystem.

The [VeChainThor blockchain](http://vechain.org) has already been applied across a diverse array of use cases including **Walmart China, Bayer China, BMW Group, BYD Auto, H&M Group, Shanghai Gas, LVMH, D.I.G, ASI Group** and more. We've pioneered [VeChain ToolChain](https://www.vechain.com/product/toolchain), a BaaS suite that allows enterprises to deploy full featured blockchain solutions without any technical knowledge required. Numerous products on shelves in Walmart China are already being tracked using VeChain with more being gradually added, and we have tens of thousands of transactions daily just for Walmart alone. Our journey has just started.

We’re also [a smart contract and dApp platform](http://docs.vechain.org) that is fast, low cost and scalable. For those of you who didn’t know, we welcome you to build your project on our blockchain. NFTs, DeFi, Gaming, Yield Farming, you name it, we can support it. [Grants are also available](https://www.vechain.org/builders/) to kickstart your project.

Ahead of our numerous progress updates this year and the **PoA 2.0** upgrade, which will massively upgrade our scalability and security even further, we’ve decided to engage with the crypto community with this AMA.

We’re also working on something exciting: [An Enterprise NFT Ecosystem](https://vechainofficial.medium.com/the-future-of-vechainthor-enterprise-nft-enft-ecosystem-137589e53974), that will support enterprise-related NFT applications, with a system and resources readily available to help enterprise-level users to create and issue NFTs to support their ecosystem growth.

***What is VeChain?***

VeChain project launched in 2015. VeChainThor is an enterprise-level public blockchain and we have worked tirelessly to build the bridges between blockchain technology and the real world. We’ve been through the entire process of building an entire network dedicated to be scalable, efficient and cost-effective, transitioning from consortium network to best-in-class public blockchain platform using our Proof of Authority consensus.

The VeChainThor blockchain is powered by the VET and VTHO currencies with a dual-token model, offering best-in-industry transaction speed, scalability and costs. We’re a public blockchain, and we support dApps as well!

I started out buying OMG and ANT (before it became NEO) back in 2017.  Those were the days!  The summer of 2017 was popping and thanks to my gains, I went from eating ramen straight out of the pack to using boiled water to soften the noodles.  Before my 2017 gains, my wife's boyfriend gained a lot of respect for me, and he even called me ""brah"" one day as he was picking up my wife for a hot date.  Man, I was on top of the world!

Fast forward to 2018, all my gains was gone.  Poof.  Overnight, I was back to eating ramen straight out of the pack.  I couldn't even afford the flavored ramen, just plain dry ramen with a generic label.  No brand names for me.  My wife's boyfriend went back to calling me Skid Mark instead of Regular Mark, and he never said ""brah"" to me ever again.  I was a loser.

The bear market was rough.  The crypto winter seemed like it would never end.  But I was diamond hands!  I hodled my coins and waited patiently.  Then, it happened!  The crypto winter was over and the bulls were back!  Life handed me a second chance!  My wife's boyfriend is back to calling me Regular Mark, and I think he's gonna call me ""brah"" again one day.  I can't believe how lucky I am!

To celebrate, I bought a pack of hot dogs and put hot dog slices in my ramen!  I still buy the non-flavored ramen cuz I want to save up and one day own a whole Satoshi.  But I believe in my dream!  And now my ramen tastes like boiled hot dog water, and I'm happier than I've ever been!

Just remember, if you believe in yourself and you hodl, you can achieve anything!"

Everywhere I see ""you should diversify"", ""don't gamble all in one coin"", et caetera.

The thing is, whatever coin you pick (if it's not just a hypecoin); the token is still in its infancy stage on the market; and will mostly follow blindly granddaddy bitcoin footsteps in his charts.

In ten another years, yeah, we might see charts going their own ways, but as for now, diversification won't do much for you. In the cryptosphere that is. You may aswell get someting that offers you some sort of stacking rewards while you're at it, if you're in for the long haul, with a project you believe in.

Now if you tell me that you got some stocks on the side; a pile of cash or precious metals, THAT is diversification, and doesn't follow the same old chart.

Making it 50/50 between two cryptos, or more, won't save you in the bear.

That's all I have to say for today. Bring on your guns, I am ready!

Have a nice day, in all cases :)"

"Doge may be a memecoin, but it brought me to this community and made me invest in other crypto.",5698,mvjzem,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mvjzem/doge_may_be_a_memecoin_but_it_brought_me_to_this/,phantomimp,1619024029.0,False,SELF-STORY,t3_mvjzem,False,908,False,0.91,"Back in february when the whole GME hype started, I saw a couple threads popping up that the Dogecoin comminity is planning to rise as well. It was too late for me to invest in GME as it already spiked, so I tried my luck with Doge and bought at 0.05€ for 50€. Not to be too risky with my first investment ever... 2 months later I cashed out (a bit too early) and made about 180€. So my total wallet was now €230, which I planned to invest in Doge again once the price dropped. 

Luckily the price stayed up and I realized that if I'd put my money back in Doge, I would only lose. Either the price stays up and I end up with less doge than I initially had or I buy when the price drops and end up with less € if it continues to drop. 

So I started looking for alternatives to invest my winnings. I searched for other ""cheap"" coins, that had a lot of potential to grow, by reading this subreddit and came across VET and ADA.  I gained some confidence by profiting from the doge investment and deposited another €500 into my wallet. I put €300 into VET and 350€ into ADA. I might put the remaining €80 back into Doge. It's an unpredictable meme after all, so who knows what happens. 

I'm planning to create a more diverse portfolio if my current investment works somewhat out. Doge might not be the most popular among the altcoins  in this sub, but it was a great starting point for me and made me interested in other crypto currencies.  I also want to thank this community for being insightful, helpful and welcoming to crypto newbies."

Now, I understand Nano came to be in a situation where smart contracts where not such a big thing, and there were no ""swaps"" and there was no staking/lending/liquidity pools etc. People want more from crypto and that's OK. But I'm not OK with freakin' SHIB and SAFEMOON having a larger mcap than Nano. I'll never be OK with that. For the love of all that is holy, SAFEMOON should not be a word any of us remember in two years. 

Sure, there were two major incidents, both occurring in the bull runs, the exchange exit scam crap and the spam attacks now.  And sure, it was shilled here relentlessly. And people hate shillers. But how can a coins main fault be ""it's fan base is annoying""?? 

/my incoherent rant, I'm just bummed something so technically great is not actually ""appreciated"" more.



**Edit**: holy amount of comments, Batman.  RIP my inbox.

Thank you everyone for the awards, there's too many of them to reply to you all individually (i still believe in thanking personally for the awards but since my inbox is MIA, this is a bit troublesome).

Also, someone was so concerned about me being bummed, a bot sent me a message about suicide hotline. While I would never do something like that over crypto (or money), I honestly appreciate the kind thought. You are (as Keanu says) breathtaking.



Take care everyone (even Safemoon holders).

**Edit 2** this has become my most upvoted post. I don't know what to say. Thank you to everyone, Nano fans and Nano haters.

Also, it seems Safemoon holders have figured out this post, so they started brigadding. Some had hilarious things to say about Nano (e.g. ""Out of #100 instant and feeless"" and ""Nano is very fast. Out of top 100hehe""). Laughs were had. Just to clarify, if Safemoon and SHIB start doing great things, there will be no one happier than me. I still think both of them have too many red flags, but I'm happy for you if you profit. Take care now and have a good day"

"To all the small hodlers, keeping your coins at an exchange might be the best thing for you",5486,lxcmup,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lxcmup/to_all_the_small_hodlers_keeping_your_coins_at_an/,CarbonatedInsidious,1614832265.0,False,EXCHANGE,t3_lxcmup,False,1204,False,0.9,"This is not Financial Advice!

You might’ve seen several posts explaining why keeping your coins in a wallet is the best way to hodl. This is true, if you have a significant amounts of a particular coin because then you will be able to cover the expenses of transfer fees which vary from coin to coin.

But with the rise of newcomers, not everyone can afford to buy large numbers of coins. And while you might be tempted to take your coins off an exchange, think about the amount you will spend for fees. For example the average fees for moving out ETH is 0.02 ETH (~$35) sometimes this is the amount most people have. Similar example can be applied to other coins as well. 

Another point is that exchanges are not un-secure anymore. They will store coins with high security measures. And you should enable things like 2FA to keep your account even more secure. So don’t worry about your coins being in danger.

If someone has any other suggestions please let us know.

Edit: Tips from comments:

1. From u/ACShreds - Gemini offers 10 free withdrawals per month so if you do want to withdraw coins, try buying from that platform although the fees are a little high compared to other platforms.

2. From u/thegooddocgonzo - Although exchanges aren’t fully safe, many big and reputable one like Coinbase and Binance will do everything to keep your coins safe because they don’t want any bad reputation. The user also notes that Binance was hacked in 2019 and Binance made sure that no customer was impacted. Stay cautious of smaller and unknown exchanges.

Edit 2: The withdrawal fee which I stated for ETH (0.02) was for the exchange I primarily use which is WazirX. I’m sorry for not mentioning the said exchange and for those asking where I got that figure here is your answer."

Here’s some quotes from the article. Sauce at the bottom. 

“If we are looking at where Bitcoin is at now, Okung could be considered one of the highest salaried NFL players at this moment.”

“For instance, when BTC hit $44k, the half of his contract that is paid in BTC climbed to $10.59 million, at $56k+ his half turned into more than his entire quoted salary. As far as 2020 NFL salary stats are concerned, Okung has entered the top five position. However, the NFL has recently decided to cap the league’s salaries at $180 million and a ball player’s contract could change in 2021. Because the Carolina Panthers’ offensive tackle (OT) gets half of his salary in BTC, many proponents think of him as the highest-paid player in the NFL and not just ahead of the highest-paid OTs.”

“Money is more than currency; it’s power,” said Okung in a statement. “The way money is handled from creation to dissemination is part of that power. Getting paid in bitcoin is the first step of opting out of the corrupt, manipulated economy we all inhabit.”

“Okung went further into that statement adding: ‘When we are all paid in bitcoin, no one can tell us what to do with the value we create … In a post-fiat world, you won’t have to worry about your labor and time being stolen.”

Credit is predatory by nature. The bank doesn't care when you max your card out on alcohol, designer clothes, gambling, or any other worthless and risky commodity. Your bank doesn't give one single tiny little shit about you in any way beyond your capacity to generate revenue. You are a revenue generating unit and nothing more, end of story. They are building artificial barriers to crypto because they view it as a direct and fundamental threat to their industries... and with good reason, because it is. The reality is anyone who invests wisely in crypto right now is going to make a significant ROI over the next few years, opening up the opportunity to pay off large balances, which decreases the revenue they earn from interest. This is nothing more than a desperate attempt at self preservation. 

Again I would encourage anyone who has their bank or credit card company create a barrier for them to purchase crypto, to immediately end doing business with that institution and make sure they know why. If my bank halts my purchases, I'll liquidate my account and close it the same day. Same goes with my credit cards, they will get cut up and never used again. DON'T bend over for them.

Within the context of the new financial account reporting  regime, cryptocurrencies and cryptoasset exchange accounts and payment  service accounts that accept cryptocurrencies would be covered. Further,  as with cash transactions, businesses that receive cryptoassets with a  fair market value of more than $10,000 would also be reported on.

PSA: Binance recently increased ADA withdrawal fees by 400% and are lying about why they did it,5373,lh39ss,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lh39ss/psa_binance_recently_increased_ada_withdrawal/,imm_uol1819,1612989619.0,False,EXCHANGE,t3_lh39ss,False,917,False,0.95,"FINAL EDIT: it's back to 1 ADA 😄

Withdrawing ADA on Binance, until 2 days ago, would ""only"" cost 1 ADA.

They increased it to 3 ADA yesterday, and some time between yesterday and today they increased it further to 5 ADA.

That's a 400% increase in less than 48h. For comparison, transaction fees on Cardano are only 0.17 ADA.

And yet, after a user from r/cardano enquired about this issue, Binance claimed that the 5 ADA fee ""depends on the blockchain and miners"" (Miners on Cardano? Am I missing something?).

Proof: https://ibb.co/5k0MMpq

EDIT: proof of higher fees https://ibb.co/b6X5zh3

This is disgusting.

They're promoting their BNB coin boasting about their low fees, making other coins like ADA look like much less appealing alternatives.

For the sake of the free market, and to prevent Binance to pull off any more shady stuff á la Robinhood, please consider complaining to Binance about this.

Not cool Binance. Not cool.

EDIT: at the time of writing, the fee is down to 2 ADA (I'm based in UK if it matters). They keep changing it, fuck knows why"

If you think I missed something, please share it in the comments so that people can check that out as well!

&#x200B;

**Coinbase Earn** **\[about $30 in different cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the most popular ways, although it is not really the quickest. You need a Coinbase account and to complete verification (so photo + document). Once you are verified, you will be put on a waiting list that usually lasts a couple of days. 

Once you get accepted, all you have to do is watch a video explaining how a project works, and answer some questions about it. It is not anything hard and you can find the answers online.

Right now, you can earn XLM, COMP, CGLD, GRT, NU, but they often update it with a new project so definitely keep the account once verified.

[LINK](https://www.coinbase.com/earn)

&#x200B;

**CoinMarketCap Earn** **\[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Basically the same as Coinbase Earn, but hosted by CoinMarketCap. For this, you'll need a CoinMarketCap account (just needs e-mail and password) and a verified Binance account (which requires verification, but there's no waiting list once verified). 

The payouts are slower than Coinbase Earn, since they are distributed after weeks and not immediately.

[LINK](https://coinmarketcap.com/earn/)

&#x200B;

**Faucets \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

This is one of the easiest and most immediate ways to get a small amount of crypto. You just need a wallet that can hold the coin and the relative address, and you're good to go.

They're basically websites that distribute small amounts of cryptos to the users asking for it, and they're supported by donations/ads and stuff like that.

There are a lot and you can often find them just by searching on Google ""<name of the coin> + faucet"".

A [good read](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/what-is-a-crypto-faucet) about them and some examples: [freenanofaucet](https://www.freenanofaucet.com/) and [Doge Faucet](https://www.dogefaucet.com/en)

&#x200B;

**Airdrops \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

An airdrop, in the cryptocurrency business, is a marketing stunt that involves sending coins or tokens to wallet addresses in order to promote awareness of a new virtual currency. 

They can be free or they might require holding certain tokens or doing small tasks.

Airdrops happen on many different platforms and for many different coins, so it's often hard to find them if you aren't familiar with the community or the platform. Anyway, [Airdrops.io](https://Airdrops.io) is a good website that gathers the best airdrops happening.

&#x200B;

**Bounties \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

In the crypto world, it is a marketing strategy where an ICO allocates a percentage of their tokens for “bounties”. These are tasks that are open to the public to complete and their reward is the new token that is launching. Once the token is launched, participants of the bounty will receive their tokens. 

As you may have noticed, they're similar to airdrops. As airdrops, it is often difficult to find them. [This](https://beta.bounty0x.io/explore) is a good website that gathers some bounties that are currently active.

&#x200B;

**WeNano \[NANO\]:**

This is one of my favorites, so I encourage you to check them out since the project is awesome.

Have you ever played Pokémon Go? Well, this is a similar app, but instead of capturing Pokémon, spots are created by users around the world, and by visiting them you can earn NANO and chat with other users. The payouts are actually really good, especially in large cities, and the community around it is awesome.

[This](https://www.wenano.net/) is the official website (it's available both for Android and iOS)

&#x200B;

**NanoQuakeJs \[NANO\]:**

Another favorite of mine. It's literally just Quake 3, on your browser, and for each kill you get some NANO. I challenge you to find something cooler.

[This](https://nanoquakejs.com/) is the website, you just need a nickname and a NANO address and you're good to go!

There are some other similar projects, one of which is [PlayerKillers](http://playerkillers.exchange/), but I mean, Quake is Quake.

&#x200B;

**Reddit \[MOON, DOGE, NANO\]:**

Yeah, Reddit. There are actually a couple of ways to earn crypto on Reddit.

First, our favorite, MOONs. You just need to set up your vault (on the app) and you're ready to receive moons next distribution! They happen once a month, and a fixed amount of moons are distributed to the r/CryptoCurrency community, based on the Karma you gained that month. So start shitposting!

Other subreddits, like Dogecoin's and Nano's have bots that allow you to tip users, so if you make a good submission there you'll probably receive some coins from kind redditors. 

Also, subs like r/dogecoinbeg exist, where you can... Well... Beg for dogecoins.

&#x200B;

**Publish0x \[ETH\]:**

This is a really cool project that I personally love. It is basically a website like Medium, where users can post blog entries.

The best thing about this is that the website provides the coins. You will literally earn crypto just by reading content on the website (which is crypto-related), sharing content and writing it (although you'll need to apply as an author to do so).

[LINK](https://www.publish0x.com/)

&#x200B;

**SteemIt \[STEEM\]:**

Steemit is a blogging and social media platform that uses blockchain technology and a cryptocurrency to reward its users for creating content, commenting, and upvoting other posts.  

It is really similar to Reddit, [here](https://steemit.com/)'s the link

[Cent](https://beta.cent.co/~discover/) is another similar social network built on top of Ethereum, worth checking out.

&#x200B;

**NFT marketplaces \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many websites offer the possibility to sell artworks, collectibles and in general NFTs. NFT, for the newcomers, stands for Non-Fungible Token, and means a token representing something unique. 

You can think of it as an art piece: although you can copy it, scan it and print it, there will only be one original copy. NFTs are used to verify and confirm the uniqueness of something and its ownership. So, let's say I make a beautiful digital painting, I can ""link"" it to this token and whoever owns the token, owns the digital painting and can therefore sell it or trade it.

[KnownOrigin](https://knownorigin.io/), [Mintable](https://mintable.app/), [Rarible](https://rarible.com/) and [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/) are all great example of such marketplaces. If you're a creative person and want to sell some of your works, those are great places to do so. 

&#x200B;

**Games and Collectibles \[various cryptocurrencies\]:**

Many games run on a blockchain, using NFTs to create unique and rare in-game assets. Think of a card game like HeartStone: on the blockchain, it is possible to create only 10 cards of a specific type (using NFTs), so only 10 users in the world can own that card, so that card would extremely rare and therefore valuable.

Usually, it is not easy to earn crypto this way, you'll need to play a bit before getting some good stuff that you can sell, but if you find a game that you like you can surely earn while having fun!

Examples of games are [MyCryptoHeroes](https://www.mycryptoheroes.net/home), [EverDragons](https://everdragons.com/), [Axie Infinity](https://axieinfinity.com/), [Decentraland](https://decentraland.org/) and [Brave Frontier Heroes](https://bravefrontierheroes.com/).

Some aren't even games at all, just collectibles that you can buy, trade and earn. Examples are [CryptoKitties](https://www.cryptokitties.co/catalogue) and [Clovers](https://clovers.network/)

&#x200B;

Endnote: especially services using NFTs on top of Ethereum are, right now, subject to really high fees that make it often impossible to trade these tokens effectively. Be careful when doing a transaction.

&#x200B;
&#x200B;

EDIT:
Some I forgot or didn't know about:

* **Brave browser**: allows you to earn BAT just by browsing and seeing ads. Both on PC and mobile.
* **ethtrader and fortniteBR**: they're also subreddits with a governance tokens (like moons), so you can earn some money shitposting there too."
"If crypto has stopped you caring about other elements of your life, you need to urgently reconsider things...",5261,m6wvqo,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/m6wvqo/if_crypto_has_stopped_you_caring_about_other/,TrueSpins,1615974876.0,False,PERSPECTIVE,t3_m6wvqo,False,626,False,0.91,"I get it.

When you're in the middle of a bull market and prices continue to rise, it's easy to think that other, more traditional methods of income are a waste of time. Your salary suddenly seems inconsequential and other investments are boring as hell.

We often talk about not putting all your money into crypto, but there's another element to this too - you shouldn't dedicate all your mental energy to crypto either.

When the next bear market comes, and it will come at some point, having nothing in your life except crypto and your portfolio app is going to make for a very depressing period.

Even if you're making paper profits of 10k a day, you still need to develop other areas of your life - whether that's career, relationships, new business ventures etc - because everyone needs something to fall back on, both financially AND mentally.

I run a small SaaS platform in my spare time, and it generates very little money in the grand scheme of things. But it's mine and I enjoy developing it and getting new customers. If the crypto market was to tank tomorrow, I'd still have this, and that would mean a lot to me. 

Equally, I also have my normal job, and whilst it can be a bit dull at times (and in recent months almost a bit pointless!) it is still something I have continued to strive at, and it's another form of personal development that can open future financial doors.

This is essentially a post about eggs and baskets, but just wanted to point out that the metaphor is more than just financial - it's also about your wider mindset and not letting other areas of your life slide."

*“Bitcoin, it just seems like a scam,” Trump said. “I don’t like it because it’s another currency competing against the dollar ... I want the dollar to be the currency of the world. That’s what I’ve always said.”*

Clearly he thinks that Bitcoin is a true competitor to the global supremecy of the USD. He is fearful of Bitcoin disrupting the USD as the standard currency of the world.

**S Tier:**

[Benjamin Cowen](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRvqjQPSeaWn-uEx-w0XOIg): Best at Macro and long term Technical Analysis, Always a calm head in this crazy market, his favorite saying is ""what's a few trillions among friends""

[JRNY Crypto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC188KLMYLLGqVJZdYq7mYFw): Best channel for MID cap coins, he consistently made good calls, most coins he shilled went up and stayed up (he doesn't dump on his followers), but even him couldn't help LTC :/

[Coin Bureau](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCqK_GSMbpiV8spgD3ZGloSw): Best educational Crypto channel, if I put him in a lower tier this sub will assassinate me (he is also not a financial advisor as he will let you know in literally every video)

[InvestAnswers](https://www.youtube.com/c/InvestAnswers/videos): Added by popular demand, he has a deep understanding of Math and the stock market which he tries to translate into the crypto market

&#x200B;

**A Tier:**

[Digital Assets News](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJgHxpqfhWEEjYH9cLXqhIQ): Had some great calls, this [*Prediction video*](https://youtu.be/zX8Di-gRHWc) is his best and it's aging like fine wine

[Bob Loukas](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC0zGwzu0zzCImC1BwPuWyXQ): The voice of reason in Crypto, he is good at predicting the start and the end of crypto cycles.

[Finematics](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCh1ob28ceGdqohUnR7vBACA): If you are in it for the tech this channel is great at making complicated concepts simple.

[Dave Levine](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCT4X1qiEPR0gsZYfze6JOyA): If there was such a thing as ETH Maxis association this guy would be the CEO, he is an OG that went through multiple cycles.

[Crazy4crypto](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNHXoNsyoBGVOS0EJarawvw): He was shilling Theta and ZIL before it was cool, he made me a lot of money

[Lark Davis](https://www.youtube.com/user/larksongbird01): I just watch him because he has cool paintings behind him, but he is good too I guess.

[Aantonop](https://www.youtube.com/user/aantonop); One of the OGs of crypto, he is a Bitcoin maxi, but his educational content is great.

**Best Podcasts tier:** [UpOnlytv](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC_Jt1VYHZO4Kc4cJQP5utdw), [Bankless](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAl9Ld79qaZxp9JzEOwd3aA), [Unchained Podcast](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWiiMnsnw5Isc2PP1to9nNw), [What Bitcoin Did](https://www.youtube.com/c/WhatBitcoinDidPodcast/videos), [Millennial Money](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPi6sb9M-Kj-j-PKptcUNJQ)

&#x200B;

**Popular Channels to Avoid Tier:**

[~~Ivan on Tech~~](https://youtube.com/c/IvanonTech) The guy who brought us ""[Respect da pump](https://youtu.be/4TlaEZt6YmQ)"": meme, but his content is terrible

[~~BitBoyCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/channel/UCjemQfjaXAzA-95RKoy9n_g): It's rumored that he dumps his coins on his followers, he promotes risky leverage and his channel content is average at best.

[~~MMCrypto~~](https://youtube.com/c/MMCryptoTube): Same as Bitboy, just empty sensationalism to lure new comers to click on his Bybit affiliate links.

[~~The Moon~~](https://youtube.com/c/TheMoonCarl): His favorite phrase is ""Exaaqctly as predicted"" He buys fake comments to pretend they are making money with his calls so can get more Bybit referrals

&#x200B;

**C, D, E, F, Z Tiers / Red Flags**

As a general rule if someone makes stupid faces in the thumbnails, 100x claims, promotes leveraged trading or Bybit links, you should stay away from him

**Disclaimers:**

DO NOT take any Youtuber's words as gospel, Do your own research, but those are a good start.

If your favorite Youtuber isn't here doesn't mean I hate them, you can add them in the comments

"The Ethereum upgrade ""London"" coming in 9 days will be a ""hard fork"" and I found out what that means so you don't have to.",5089,osis3a,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/osis3a/the_ethereum_upgrade_london_coming_in_9_days_will/,bexji,1627374290.0,False,SECURITY,t3_osis3a,False,1222,False,0.92,"**What is a Hard Fork?**

A hard fork is when nodes of the newest version of a blockchain no longer accept the older version(s) of the blockchain; which creates a permanent divergence from the previous version of the blockchain.

Adding a new rule to the code essentially creates a fork in the blockchain: one path follows the new, upgraded blockchain, and the other path continues along the old path. Generally, after a short time, those on the old chain will realize that their version of the blockchain is outdated or irrelevant and quickly upgrade to the latest version.

&#x200B;

[Hard Fork Illustration ](https://preview.redd.it/uu6wwcd8rpd71.png?width=3024&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0266b64169bfe7d49d1b6a6d6c61369c63141a4)

In a hard fork, holders of tokens in the original blockchain will be granted tokens in the new fork as well, but miners must choose which blockchain to continue verifying.

A hard fork can occur in any blockchain even Bitcoin (where hard forks have created Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin SV, among several others or Ethereum classic from a previous upgrade)

**""Well if there's a hardfork isn't there also soft fork?"" Yes that's exactly right.**

Hard forks and soft forks are essentially the same in the sense that when a cryptocurrency platform's existing code is changed, an old version remains on the network while the new version is created.

With a soft fork, only one blockchain will remain valid as users adopt the update. Whereas with a hard fork, both the old and new blockchains exist side by side, which means that the software must be updated to work by the new rules. Both forks create a split, but a hard fork creates two blockchains and a soft fork is meant to result in one. 

For example, a block size *decrease* can be implemented by soft-forking. However, doing so doesn’t automatically disconnect you from the network. You still communicate with nodes that aren’t implementing those rules, but you filter out some of the information they pass you.

Edit:  This hardfork requires **no action** for anyone who is holding ETH (Except for node operators). You can keep your Ethereum where it currently is.

Cryptocurrency has changed the dynamics in Iran. The Iranian government's view on it has been quite lax compared to neighboring countries or other Muslim countries. There was either support for it or it was simply ignored since you couldn't really spend it on anything. On top of that, given the fact that Iran is disconnected from international banking, there was less concern from Iranian banks. (A bit ignorant, but I am not complaining)

But things have changed drastically over the past few years. The increased sanctions and COVID have brought a lot more people towards crypto, including me. Crypto has a very unique situation in Iran, which I will try to explain briefly. The Iranian currency is currently the cheapest in the world (or one of the cheapest, as its unstable and can change daily). So if someone can earn dollars and spend it in Iran, they are going to profit a lot. We are talking close to 25x increase. This makes mining insanely profitable. Because you are going to pay for your electricity in Iranian currency, but you are earning dollars, because crypto exchange rate is based on western currencies, not Iranian. So electricity is dirt cheap to begin with, but you can get it even cheaper.

There are ways to get free electricity in Iran. The government subsidizes businesses that have high electricity usage, so they get publicly funded electricity. So the owner of these businesses makes deals with individuals to buy hardware needed to mine currency (because the initial cost is very high due to currency difference), and usually one person with contacts overseas becomes the ""broker"" to be able to turn these cryptos into tangible money.  People without these businesses tend to form mining communities where they work together to discreetly mine and turn crypto into actual currency and due to the fact that a lot of people are dealing in crypto now, you can actually find a lot of buyers locally, and don't even need to sell it to foreigners.

So, this way crypto got introduced into society and a lot of people use it. Usually not as an investment, but as a currency you use to spend on things. Because in order to make an international purchase, you need to abuse a lot of loopholes, such as VPNs, middlemen and exchange rates. But now I can simply buy steam gift cards with bitcoin and use them to buy games. This applies to any international purchase. 60$ games used to cost a fortune, like an entire minimum wage income in Iran. Now they are widely available if you have crypto.

The usual mishandling of the Iranian government in regards to the economy is bad enough, but in recent years sanctions and COVID have made it a three way hell. My life personally was hell because I could not make any international purchase and I could barely make ends meet. Crypto is so empowering. I am basically able to earn and spend money despite the efforts of both Iranian and American governments. In order to put things in perspective, I can use myself as an example. I am a lawyer and I earn more money from mining that I do practicing law. I am still working, but crypto is a great secondary income which I can use to make international purchases without having to pay half of my income for a 100$ purchase. We are still in bad conditions, but crypto provides a lifeline. At least for now.

I am grateful for cryptocurrency and this community, because the livelihood of many people in Iran relies on crypto and information about it. Most people involved in crypto trade in Iran don't even speak English, but know that an entire country is thankful for it, and the value of crypto could not be clearer. An entire people neglected by their own government and sanctioned by half the world, left to basically starve and live in terrible conditions, continue to go on. In large part, thanks to crypto currencies. We practically have the power to defy the strongest governments in the world, the next step is THE MOON.

I was going to reply in a comment, but I feel that a lot of people can benefit from a short write-up on them.

#What is a sell wall?

A sell wall is a tool used by a rich individual,or group of rich individuals, to manipulate the price of a stock downwards. A large sell order is set at a specific price by the whale(s) to prevent higher sell orders from executing.

A sell wall looks like this on the depth chart: http://brettwestbrook.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Screen-Shot-2017-07-12-at-12.58.10-PM.png

###How does it work?

This is best explained as an example.

A wealthy person, we will call him Richard, tells a group of his wealthy friends that he wants to make money on a particular stock. This could be for a number of reasons such as:

* The stock has a lot of room to grow
* The stock can be easily manipulated
* The stock has a lot of potential to get big in the near future

Richard and his friends decide that it's a good idea. They all want 1 million of X cryptocurrency. *Unfortunately, in the cryptocurrency market Richard and his friends can't execute all the buy orders at once or the prices will skyrocket!* 


To achieve 1 million obtained goal, they decide to set up a sell wall, and manipulate the price downwards. They do this in steps:

1. They accumulate together. They will maybe get 250,000 of X crypto each. In their specific market, this didn't affect the price that much. Great! 

2. They now set a specific price they feel is low enough for them to be able to reach their 1m X crypto goal. For this particular crypto they decide to all sell their obtained crypto at $2.40.

3. Now, between Richard and the group, there is >1 million dollars worth of X crypto selling for @2.40 on the market, a seemingly undervalued price.There is SO much volume being sold now, buying pressure cannot eat through that wall in a reasonable time frame - it would take a very high buying pressure to do so. 

What also happens next is the key: nobody else can sell above that sell wall price until it's gone. The result? People need to sell lower than the sell wall in order to liquefy their stock. This drives the price downwards.

Richard and his friends can now safey all get to their 1m X crypto mark without raising the price exponentially! When they decide to rid their sell walls the price moves up accordingly!

##How can you use this to your advantage?

A common thought is that the main goal of a sell wall is to instill fear into the weaker hands so that they sell by the thought that ""Oh no everyone is selling!!"" While it's not the main purpose, it probably does happen a little bit. People get nervous when things a large volume of crypto is being sold.

As Warren Buffet said: *Be Fearful When Others Are Greedy and Greedy When Others Are Fearful.*

For a real life example:

VECHAIN. 

For those that don't know, about a month ago vechain was sitting around 29 cents. They had a pretty large announcement that was, yes, front page of reddit. The price nearly doubled to 70 cents (it actually happened right before the announcement). 

What happened after? Some people bought the rumor and sold the news. But, this news was really big. Masternodes, rebranding, big partnerships. Ask any VEN holder why the price didn't continue to rise after that and they will probably know why - price manipulation with sell walls.

Such as: https://i.redd.it/bjaubsgn04601.png

VECHAIN has had a lot of new partnerships, announcements, and generally great news to propel the crypto further, but has been held back by these sells walls constantly. Just recently buying pressure has been very high and the whales have been having trouble controlling it they way they would like.

That's a real example of what has been happening. Take a look at roadmaps and see where different projects are at in development. Are any projects getting seemingly great news without moving in price?

What about REQ? We saw a couple of front page posts about REQ moving to main net, quality pictures from the UI, etc etc. REQ was fairly stagnant around 30 cents before slingshotting to 80 cents in nearly a day. Sell walls and price manipulation.This field is speculative so any news drives buying pressure. Unfortunately, the very wealthy have a say as well. 

Look for great projects and determine if they solve a need. Look to see what's hitting the media's spot light, such as the front page here. **THEN take a look at the depth charts on the exchanges.** In crypto anything goes, and you better believe the very wealthy have difficult to obtain knowledge. When you see these obvious sell walls, you want to investigate and try to identify any trends. 

Perhaps you can look at **volume** of a cryptocurrency. A stagnant crypto with LOTS of volume is a huge indicator, sideways consolidation. Ripple did this for a few weeks, even months at certain stages. 

Once you find one that looks good - **you'll need to hold at the mercy of the whales.** Trust me, they want profit more than you do. The wait is almost always worth it because price will rise very rapidly once selling pressure is completely abolished.


Hope this helps guys.

Recently, I made a trade and sold off some crypto to keep some funds in USD for a move down I anticipated happening.  Everything was going according to plan and the next morning I got up to make my trade, only to find more than $1000 was missing from my USD funds.

&#x200B;

[The $11 buy was with separate money](https://preview.redd.it/ikvei79uho871.png?width=1044&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb7a73aebf9c8f9d99d08c7ee3eb8b3a0d2f495)

Confused, I tried to reach out to [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) to no avail.  I did some research and found out people have been waiting months for tickets to be resolved.  That was unacceptable to me, so I filed formal complaints with the BBB and the SEC, of which both cases are still open at the time of this writing.

Today, [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) emailed me back and notified me they removed $1000 from my trade because ""their records"" show a deposit I made on the 25th of June never went through.  

&#x200B;

[This is the first indication I got of where the money went](https://preview.redd.it/x4y4wdp8jo871.png?width=701&format=png&auto=webp&s=4f94935728d624b64c5456677d638fdcfe13320b)

Confused, I logged into my bank account to check my account and sure enough, there was a transaction for $1000 on June 25th.

[Bank Statement](https://preview.redd.it/b7r6h0fkjo871.png?width=1028&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3c42ed146079c84c70640419107325757db1a1d)

The most alarming thing about this is that [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) gave me ZERO indication that they were doing this, and if I wasn't the type of person who pays very close attention to his account, that money would have been gone forever with me being none the wiser.  There were no emails, no alerts, nothing on my account, zilch, to indicate what they did.  And to top it all off, it was done in the middle of the night, somewhere between 3-4am PST, as the market was falling.  So when I woke up, the PNL looked as if it was a normal red day.  To top it all off, they took MORE than $1000 when they removed the money from my account.

If you guys are using [Binance.US](https://Binance.US), get your money off of that exchange ASAP and watch your funds like a hawk.  There will likely be a lawsuit that stems from these types of practices, and it shows that [Binance.US](https://Binance.US) is being grossly incompetent with people's money to the point of negligence.  Please do not use them and use this message to protect yourself.


UPDATE: Binance.US is doubling down and saying they never received the funds.  I called my bank and they confirmed the transaction did go through in a timely manner.  

I traced out my bank statement with my USD deposits on Binance.US and they match up perfectly, minus the $1000 + a few extra they took without telling me."

Let’s start with reddit and MOONS. I know at the moment even though the amount of moons per karma has decreased incredibly it’s still such an amazing concept to get your head around. Rewarding the user with tokens that could potentially earn the users money just for providing good content is extraordinary. This seems like a good step in the right direction instead of things like likes on Instagram where their only value is self esteem. In addition, it’s not focused on appearance so it’s a lot less biased; anyone with a good thing to say will be upvoted no matter what they look like. 

Next is brave and BATS. I understand that if brave went mainstream then they would earn a ridiculous amount of money through advertisement but this would also then be split with the person that’s getting the advertisement shoved down their throat. I know I would personally prefer to get payed for being manipulated by ads then just be manipulated for free. Not to mention the other benefits brave has to offer.

I've seen a lot of posts here and in /r/ethereum talking about high fees. I've also seen a lot of extremely misleading statements here and there about how high fees are right now and will try and simplify things a bit. I'll do my best to remain impartial, and feel free to correct me and I'll edit my post. All plans are subject to change, the following is based on my current understanding and recollection of developer statements.

>What is happening?

* ETH fees are high right now. The best place to see gas costs (how much you'll need to pay for a transaction vs how quickly you want it) is here: https://ethgasstation.info/

* Smart contracts and ERC-20 tokens consume much more gas than a basic transfer. While a typical transfer might be $3 a poorly written smart contract could consume $100 in gas. This variation leads to lots of confusion on various forums. An absolute metric crap ton of tokens run on ETH, so ETH being congested causes lots of downstream effects, tokens that consume lots of gas are disproportionately effected.

>Why is this happening?

 * [Utilization is through the roof right now](https://txstreet.com/v/eth-btc). At post time ETH is achieving 16.14 TPS vs BTC's 4.00. Despite being 4 times faster the demand for on-chain (L1) transactions is overwhelming. At the bottom of [this page, make sure to scroll down](https://ethgasstation.info/index.php) you can see that blocks are at 100% right now. That means people are constantly outbidding each other to make it in.

 * At post time [Uniswap](https://ethgasstation.info/gasguzzlers.php) is the biggest gas guzzler. People are using Decentralized Exchanges (dex'es) a ton and its consuming a huge chunk of block space and people are paying a premium for it.

>How can I save money?

 * ETH demand fluctuates heavily throughout the day, it's not uncommon for fees to drop 10x in an hour. If you are not in a hurry waiting a bit for a slow period and broadcasting a median gas transaction can save you a TON of money

 * Some wallets/apps are designed to be super user friendly, and unfortunately they hardcode the fastest possible gas costs for a good user experience (UX). Unfortunately that's a very bad idea when gas is high and only causes rates to climb even more. EIP-1559 will fix this, more on that later

 * Don't interact with smart contracts if you don't have to. It sucks, I know. But the fact is that using a smart contract is way more expensive than normal transactions. When gas is a fraction of a penny nobody cares, but its not right now and this is where we are. Last I checked, L1 [ETH](https://ycharts.com/indicators/ethereum_average_transaction_fee) transfers are still cheaper than [BTC](https://ycharts.com/indicators/bitcoin_average_transaction_fee). Not much of a consolation, but it's not a *total* disaster yet. EDIT: It appears the last 2 days ETH has flipped BTC on transaction costs. $17 USD still seems really really high, as of post-time a $5 transaction would go through within a few minutes)

>What is being done about this? (sorted by est delivery date)

 * Berlin upgrade: Est 1-2 months, will adjust gas costs of various transactions for certain core operations. Should help fees overall on many contracts.

 * EIP-1559: Est ""this summer, but maybe Q3"": A huge overhaul to the fee system. Block sizes are FLEXIBLE, targeting 50% full. When a block exceeds 50% full the base fee increases. When it drops below 50% the base fee decreases. Fees are burned (nice deflationary side effect). This means a few things: A) Spikes in transactions can make the next block instead of clogging the mem pool B) costs are MUCH more easy to calculate, and block include time estimation is much easier. C) The improved predictability/include time means shitty apps won't have a reason to set absurd fees for a good UX, driving ""gas inflation"" like we see now. There's a lot more to EIP-1559, but that's the gist of how it should impact transactions

 * 2.0 Phase 0: Already live, but the beacon chain won't impact 1.0 until ""the merge"". Baseline TPS should be higher than 1.0, and its also environmentally friendly :)

 * 2.0 Phase 1: Est end of 2021, Sharding will first scale to 64 shards (eventually 1024) for a 64x scaling effect on the beacon chain. 

 * The Merge: Some call this Phase 1.5, but it is planned for 2022. This will move ETH 1.0 as a shard on to 2.0, and all finality will occur on the beacon chain. At this point ETH's core TPS should be 64-100x faster than what we have today

 * 2.0 Phase 2: Est end of 2022/2023, Execution Environments aka sharded smart contracts allow for smart contracts to share data across shards so that DeFi/Dex'es etc benefit from 2.0's massive scalability

>What other out-of-order improvements are coming?

 * Various L2 technologies are already live, and several smart contracts are upgrading to them now. This will let you pay on L1 to ""get in"", then perform a lot of cheap transactions on L2. Right now every trade on uniswap clogs L1. When it runs on L2 all those trades are off-chain and gas fees are only driven up by deposits/withdrawals. This should have a massive impact on overall gas costs. The good news is the insane fees on some contracts act as an INCENTIVE to get L2 up and running faster.

I know a lot of people are unhappy with the current situation, but a lot of progress has been made and a lot of exciting progress is on the horizon! I hope this post helps :)"

On July 25, the price started trending up and crossed above 50 day moving average and today it crossed the 200 day moving average as well.

The 50 day moving average has started trending back up. If price keeps rising at this rate then it will cross back above 200 day average. This is called a golden cross and it could be happen in 1 week to 10 days time.

Golden cross is one of the strongest signs of a new bull cycle. When it happens so soon after death cross, it shows the bulls were just taking a little break and now they're back in business.

A face melting pump is on the way. It will make 2013 and 2017 bull cycles seem like nothing."

Many of you suggested some really good improvements to the bot and I am currently writing all the suggestions down in a plan to potentially release this as an application.

Here is a quick breakdown of what the bot does:

* It buys bitcoin if Elon talks positively about bitcoin on twitter
* It stops the loss at 5% and takes profit at 10%

And here are potential improvements based on your feedback:

* The bot should be able to work with multiple coins and keywords
* The bot should be able to follow multiple Twitter handles and ideally other websites too
* The bot should tweet the rocket emoji whenever it places a trade 🚀
* It should be user-configurable and ideally come with an easy to navigate user interface.
* The bot ideally analyses the weight of the influence on the crypto market for each influencer chosen

Your input made motivated me to release an official application for this project, and if you're comfortable with coding and would like to contribute drop me a message if you would like to collaborate on it!

These are the 6 U.S. Senators at fault for killing the crypto industry in the U.S. Vote them out!,4696,p1njuf,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p1njuf/these_are_the_6_us_senators_at_fault_for_killing/,poiytrewq1066,1628596016.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_p1njuf,False,1090,False,0.86,"You've probably heard by now that, despite our best efforts, the U.S. Senate *failed to even vote* on any alternative to the horrible cryptocurrency provision that may kill the crypto industry in the U.S. This means that wallet producers, miners, Dapp creators, and basically everyone else will now require KYC of their customers/users or face harsh penalties from the IRS (the U.S. tax collector). These are the 6 Senators (listed in no particular order) who are responsible for the cryptocurrency disaster in the Infrastructure Bill. We will remember their actions and vote them out!

**Rob Portman (R-OH)** – drafted the disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision. When Toomey, Wyden, and Lummis introduced an amendment to fix the provision, Rob Portman publicly supported their amendment before blindsiding everyone with his own, worse amendment. Portman has proved himself to be a puppet for Janet Yellen and Wall Street.

**Mark Warner (D-VA)** – wrote the worse crypto amendment with Rob Portman, creating chaos in the Senate and causing Portman to recant his previous support of the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. Because the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis was bipartisan and already widely expected to pass, Mark Warner’s co-authorship of the Portman amendment gave the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment bipartisan sponsorship, giving it legitimacy to contend the Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.

**Kyrsten Sinema (D-AZ)** – did not write the worse crypto amendment with Portman and Warner, but signed onto the amendment later to give it legitimacy. Kyrsten Sinema was one of the two leaders of the Senate Infrastructure Bill negotiations, along with Rob Portman. Once Sinema signed onto the Portman/Warner amendment, it became extremely difficult for other senators to publicly oppose the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment, because it became a symbolic rejection of the Infrastructure Bill as a whole. This is why we only saw Republicans who already indicated they would vote against the Infrastructure Bill publicly commit to the better, Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment.

**Bill Hagerty (R-TN)** – 99 out of 100 Senators voted to expedite the Infrastructure Bill, which would have led to an opportunity for proper consideration, debate, and voting on the cryptocurrency amendments. Bill Hagerty was the ONLY Senator to vote against expedition. This forced the Senate to either take a vote to end debate and force a vote on the *whole* Infrastructure Bill within 30 hours, or to take a recess until September 13, 2021. Once the Senate voted to end debate, it meant that the cryptocurrency amendments would not even be voted on without unanimous consent of all 100 Senators. Hagerty effectively increased the number of Senators who needed to support a crypto amendment from 60 to 100.

**Richard Shelby (R-AL)** – 99 out of 100 Senators consented to vote on the mega-compromise Toomey/Lummis/Warner/Portman/Sinema amendment which was substantially similar to the good Toomey/Wyden/Lummis amendment. It was widely expected to pass, and we would have seen a resounding success. However, Richard Shelby was the ONLY Senator to refuse to consent, because he conditioned his consent on the Senate also approving $50 billion in military spending. When this idiotic ultimatum was rejected, Richard Shelby objected to the cryptocurrency amendment, leaving Portman’s disastrous, original cryptocurrency provision intact.

**John Thune (R-SD)** – the Senate Minority Whip. His ONE job is to make sure that the Republican senators vote with party leadership. He failed this TWICE by allowing Bill Hagerty and Richard Shelby to block the crypto amendments. How hard could it be to get corrupt politicians to vote with a corrupt party? Just promise to give the Republicans candy if they vote with the party. I used that strategy to win my middle school student government election in a landslide.

Also, fuck **Janet Yellen**. The unelected, 74-year-old Secretary of the Treasury was the person behind the cryptocurrency provision in the first place, as well as the Portman/Warner/Sinema amendment. It’s no surprise that the woman who took $7.2 million in speaking fees over the last two years (almost entirely from banks) was behind this attempt, at every step of the way, to systematically destroy cryptocurrency and DeFi. And of course, because she was unelected, we have no way to vote her out."

Now, you might be wondering why I wouldn't regret spending what is now worth half a million dollars on fake rocks in a videogame, but the more I've thought about the more I've realized:

- At $3 bitcoin still felt like a fun experiment. I had NO idea what I had. 
- More importantly, let's say I kept those coins. When Bitcoin hit $20 I would have been tempted to sell. When it hit $100 I would have been verrry tempted to sell. $1,000? I'd cash out for sure. There are so many milestones where I and many of us thought it was topping out where I without question would have so;d, especially in the early years. The likelihood of me keeping those coins for a decade with the assumption that today's prices were even possible at all is extremely unlikely.

Today, VeChain Foundation hosted the rebrand event showcasing the consortium chain VeChain to the public blockchain VeChainThor. This event was an invite-only occasion for media and partners with a live stream to YouTube. During the event, Sunny Lu and Luca Crisciotti of DNV GL talked about the past, present, and future of VeChain. 

Sunny clarified that VeChain's uniqueness is not only technical but also its understanding of ecosystems. He pointed to the governance and economic models as examples. This sentiment was echoed by Luca as he assured everyone that after meeting with countless blockchain solution representatives he chose VeChain as the partner for DNV GL because of their understanding and dedication to the customer. 

This mindset has lead to over 180 opportunities for VeChain in 2018. Many of these opportunities are left unannounced, but in the course of the event, VeChain announced several new partners and opportunities including the University of Oxford Mathematical Institute, Carbon Bank solutions, BitOcean ICO, food sourcing, and BMW Group. 

Also in this event, Sunny Lu showcased three decentralized applications (DApps) that are being built to cater towards the mainnet launch. Those DApps include:

* VeVID -  KYC and digital ID maintenance solution that can be native to all VeChain applications or partners. [You can read the official announcement here.](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/vechains-first-official-public-infrastructural-decentralized-application-vevid-cd97bdf98670) 

* VeVOT - A voting service that will be initially used by the VeChain governance model. This solution will be available for other general voting events to be logged on the blockchain such as government voting and board votes. Voting results will be audited by independent partners and certified on the blockchain. 

* VeSCC - Smart contracts on the VeChainThor mainnet can be categorized into certified and uncertified, which can be checked in the explorer. The certification of smart contracts covers various aspects including the identity of the owner, the legality of the purpose, and the security of the source code. 

At the event, the carbon bank solution was made public to raise awareness that VeChain is building solutions alongside DNV GL that will monitor, analyze, and reduce the carbon footprint. This solution is being used and researched by universities (Tsinghua University), businesses, and government bodies.

In this event Sunny Lu took the time to introduce the University of Oxford (Mathematical Institute) as a partner in the VeChain ecosystem and will be working on assuring the economic model is working as intended for VET holders, VeThor users, and new customers. It was also mentioned that Japanese FSA certified partner BitOcean would be the first ICO on VeChainThor.

Luca Crisciotti left with words of encouragement of VeChain “We are not talking about pilot projects, we are talking about solutions that are working for real cases.” Luca went on to say:“DNV GL is a company with over 150 years of history. And unfortunately, this is something we can not share, because you [VeChain] were only born a few months ago. But we do have something in common, and it's a bright future. So thank you Sunny for the partnership and this amazing event.”

DOUBLE WARNING. The person warning you of whale manipulation is actually a whale trying to manipulate you.

The [original post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/op6xvs/bitcoin_will_reach_75k_in_september_heres_how/) provided an excellent stegosauric analysis and predicted a price of $75k in September, as shown below:

Then a user by the name of Chance Underscore Waters (is that even your real name?) came along and made a post about how the SUR pattern is BS, instead opting for the Bart Simpson skateboard market pattern:

[False skateboard market \\""prediction\\"" pushed by a blue whale](https://preview.redd.it/dm5ux1jdcxc71.png?width=703&format=png&auto=webp&s=311b2692de973cc20498220fda26a092612b6f2d)

They equated this to the tulip mania, but forgot one important thing: Bart Simpson's initials spell out BS. You see, the whale showed you a zoomed in chart so you would dump your coins, leaving them cheap for whales to swoop in and take. **THIS** is the market manipulation they ""warned"" you about.

What they didn't tell you about is the tried-and-true Half-Pipe Valuation strategy or HPV. Gross. Anyone that played even a minute of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater knows that the real money is in the half-pipes. I've rewired my GPUs to calculate the direction of the market and it produced the following chart:

Some of this will be talking about the world  outside of cryptos - specifically other markets, equities, and a bigger picture. If that's not allowed on this subreddit, totally understood, but I thought I'd bring an outsiders perspective to this, since I am utterly unsurprised by the events of the day and have been expecting this (or something like it) for some time. 

This is not meant as financial advice. Do your own research. Make your  own decisions. If you think I’m right, great! Act on it. If you think  I’m wrong, great! Act on it. Do your own thing. I'm just some guy on the internet, and my opinions are about as valuable as a guy spinning a sign on a street corner.

Finally, this is not intended as a FUD post - if you come to  the same conclusions I have, there will certainly be fear involved, but hopefully no uncertainty or doubt, and you can make decisions that lead to healthy financial outcomes for yourselves and loved ones. I’d  like to post a TLDR that everything is going to be okay at the end, but I  don’t necessarily think that’s going to be the case. I think scary and volatile times lay in our immediate future. I have no crystal ball, and whether that's tomorrow or 3 months from now I don't know, but I think we're facing choppy seas. 

I believe we're about to see a major market correction, and the volatility in cryptocurrencies is just the beginning. I believe this will hit every sector of the economy, from housing prices to the value of the USD. I believe cryptocurrencies in particular will see extreme volatility, both in a downward trajectory and later, an upward trajectory. 

Here are some core premises this speculation will be based on. 

1. Cryptocurrencies have not yet found a price equilibrium that reflects  their ultimate value. Currently, they are a speculative asset.

2. Despite not having to file their positions on their 13F forms, hedge  funds and investment banks are very much involved in cryptos.

3. Cryptos are a relatively unregulated market, which makes pump and dumps a much easier prospect. 

4. In their current form, cryptos have not achieved any real detachment  from the US dollar. Meaning, that when the market goes up, cryptos go  up, and when the market goes down, so do cryptos. Their promise of  breaking from the USD an becoming an intrinsically stable currency appears to not have matured  for the moment. 

Here are some ancillary premises. 

1. In order to shore up the economy during covid, the government did a  few things: it started loaning money at 0% interest like crazy, and it  reduced collateral requirements to increase liquidity in the  marketplace.

2. Collateral is heavily rehypothicated right now. An example of this  goes as follows: company A has a 20 year treasury bond. It’s keeping it  on its books as collateral to meet its margin requirements so that a lender will give it money to invest on margin. Company A then proceeds to lend  that treasury bond to company B. Company A keeps it on its books though, because  they can recall it as collateral any time they need to in order to meet their own collateral requirements. B now goes to  a lender and says “hey, I have this treasury bond as collateral,  will you lend me some money?” This process is repeated several times, until you eventually have an absolutely massive amount of margin being lent out on a single treasury bond serving as collateral. Go take a peak at the repo market. People are literally paying borrow US Treasuries to hold as collateral because collateral has been so overleveraged. 

3. During Covid, the economy has suffered. unemployment is up, supply chains have been stressed, companies have been going out of business, and savings have actually gone up for the lucky people who have been able to hang on to their jobs, and they're not out spending money. This has lead to an abnormal situation in which the stock market, which is typically (at least loosely) tied to the economy and goes up or down in tandem with the economy as a whole disconnecting - meaning that while the economy is doing poorly, the stock market has boomed to a new ATH at an unprecedented rate. 

4. Margin debt in the financial markets has seen an enormous spike in the last year. The market as a whole is extremely leveraged - which means that small events can have enormous impacts, and wider market implications. 

And finally, here are some more speculative premises. These concern what I believe is, and will be the catalyst, and the hope for crypto in the future, but they're not essential for the argument that the market correction is imminent. 

 

1. Naked short selling is an enormous problem facing the US financial markets. To understand why, it's important to understand the difference between short selling (locating and borrowing a share, selling it, and promising to buy it back later on the hopes of a lower price), and naked short selling (creating a synthetic share that was never issued by the original company and selling it). 
2. Naked short selling has long seen lax oversight by the regulatory agencies. Through a series of revolving doors and allowing the markets to run their own regulatory agencies, this enormously profitable business gets a blind eye from the regulators tasked with stopping it, because those same regulators are ultimately also the ones who profit from it when they move back into the private industry. 
3. Naked short selling is the financial equivalent of creating a counterfeit share, selling it for profit at the cost to the shareholders and company, and having 0 intention of paying it back. This tanks company value, and effectively steals value from actual shareholders. It has been used for decades to drive companies out of business. Occasionally, you get a company like Overstock that beats the odds and sees a short squeeze followed by a share price resurgence, but it frequently results in a company going out of business. 
4. Naked short selling can be hidden in a variety of ways. While people frequently turn to the short interest as a way to examine how shorted a company is, there are a variety of methods that market makers can employ using options chains to create FTD's (shares that are a failure to deliver because they never had them in the first place, and never intended to find) and then recycling those FTD's ad-infinitum until the targeted company goes bust.  
5. When Covid hit, several hedge funds, banks, and market makers decided which companies they were going to short into oblivion, and profit off of their demise. They picked companies that would in theory be particularly hard hit by a reduction in customers that were used to entering a physical location.  
6. For many companies, those efforts failed. The companies did not go out of business, and these Hedge funds and market makers find themselves in a position where they cannot close their positions, they are losing money every day. The two most well known companies in this position are AMC and GME. 
7. Shorting a company exposes the short position to infinite loss. 
8. There has never been a perfect storm of a short squeeze as GME. AMC may squeeze to a lesser extent - but it has no where near the amount of shorts that GME does. 
9. There are a variety of catalysts that can cause GME and AMC to squeeze. Contrary to common opinion, the surge in share price in January and February was due to what's called a gamma squeeze, not a short squeeze, and the shorts have not covered.   


Which brings us up to today. I believe that multiple hedge funds and market makers are in very deep on their short positions, and that they are fighting on a day by day basis at this point to stay solvent. I believe that if the US financial market is the overloaded and unstable Jenga tower, these companies are the live hand grenade placed on top of the tower, and have had the pin pulled.   


However, whether or not they're the catalyst is relatively unimportant in the overall picture - the markets are over leveraged on crazy high margin right now either way. There was a liquidity test last week, and the results were not published, but the markets have been...sketchy at best since then. Because of how over leveraged the market is, I believe that virtually any hedge fund that gets margin called is too big too fail, because it's walking on that much of a knifes edge. And when it comes down, it's going to take everything down with it, from the real estate market (both commercial and residential). I believe that speculative assets in tech and crypto are going to be particularly hard hit. The house of cards is staggering like a drunk man that just got hit in the head, and doesn't know that he's bleeding internally and about to die of an aneurysm.   


So why did Crypto across the board see such a huge (and similar across different currencies) dip followed by a massive rebound? Because as a largely unregulated asset, it's extremely ripe for pump and dumps. Hedge funds can use it to inflate their assets on paper and get access to margin.   


And I believe that yesterday they got margin called. GME has been sitting above what the speculated margin call price should be for a day or two now (although nobody is certain what the exact price is at the moment, the speculation is between 170-180) and their lenders were demanding better collateral than the crypto they had on their books. When you get margin called, you have some time to come up with the required collateral before it's considered a default and your broker starts liquidating your positions. I believe they met their margin requirements this morning, managed to hold off default for another day, and immediately started pumping crypto again. They simultaneously shorted GME down and dropped the price from $180 to $165, thus probably lowering their margin requirements as well.   


Again, I can't stress this enough: while I believe that GME and the hedge funds and market makers massive short position is involved, the argument that a bunch of hedge funds got margin called yesterday is not dependent on that - the market has been dipping the past few days, and it could simply be a matter of being over leveraged and seeing a few red days in the market that caused a margin call. All of the people all over the world that have been buying GME at unprecedented rates for the past 4 months could be totally wrong. But even if they are, this crypto dump still has the looks of a margin call. Both BTC and ETH have dropped over 50% from their ATH this morning before the rebound. The timing of hitting their low points 3 minutes before OCC-007 (which raises collateral requirements for the month) came into effect seems telling to me that somebody was really close to going under.   


And I believe that this is the first of many margin calls, and eventually, somebody is going to default, and the dominos will begin to fall, leading to a massive market correction (or collapse, depending on how you want to look at it) that leaves everybody hurting bad.   


What happens next, and how I personally plan to respond is more up in the air. The Fed can respond to this in a variety of ways. They can opt to fire up the printer and start devaluing our currency to try and buy our way out of debt with a worthless USD, or they can opt to embrace the pain and raise interest rates and create a few decades of pain and stagnation while we dig our way out of a deep depression through long term austerity. Whether or not I (and everybody else betting on the GME thesis) are right will also play a big role in what happens next. If we are correct, it's going to create what is essentially a black hole for liquidity in the markets, as money flows out of the hands of the wealthy and leaves big reliable blue chip companies, and moves into the hands of GME holders. If that's the case, money is going to be flowing into the hands of people who have a deep, deep distrust of the US financial system and the regulatory agencies, and I anticipate a massive boom in crypto's as people look for places to store their money outside of US financial market control. If my speculation is correct, we'll see bitcoin hit the teens (or maybe even single digits) before they begin to climb back up, and we'll eventually see surging and setting new ATH's in the near future afterwards, and a similar story for ETH. I'm less certain about the less well known coins - my assumption is that they will not see nearly as much of a rebound as BTC and ETH, but who knows.   


If the GME thesis is not correct, but the economy does crash and the fed Fed fires up the printer, I still anticipate a huge rebound in crypto - it is, afterall, still ripe for pump and dumps, and at the end of the day, it is in theory a pretty good place to store value in an inflation resistant location.   


If the Fed opts to raise interest rates and embrace deflation over at the opposite end of the spectrum though, than cash will be king and crypto will be utterly screwed for the next 5-10 years I'd bet. If hyper inflation is a great way of turning a Weimar Republic into a Nazi Germany, deflation and austerity are a great way of turning into Greece. Neither are great options though. Hopefully some smarter people can come up with something better.    


TLDR: If the market crashes, which is very likely, Crypto is set to take an enormous dip with it. Every hedge fund that's dipped its toes in is going to dump it like a hot potato, and if you thought it dipped fast this morning when it dropped over 20% in an hour, what comes next will make your head spin. But for now, they met their margin call and live to fight another day. Eventually though, somebody is going to trip and the economy is going down with them. And when that happens the Fed will be forced to embrace either inflation or deflation, and I expect Crypto to rebound if they choose inflation. Additionally, if the theory of GME turns out to be correct, there's going to be quite a few new millionaires with money burning a hole in their pocket to be spent, and they'll be looking for speculative inflation resistant assets that are not subject to corrupt US regulatory agencies. There's always the possibility that over the next few months, companies slowly manage to deleverage and increase their collateral without causing a market wide panic for the exits, and simultaneously the GME theory of everything is wrong, and the markets continue largely as they have been now.   


Whatever the case, I believe it's going to be a bumpy ride with more volatility in the near future, and I wish all of you the best. Good luck to everybody."

Here's the actual explanation of what they are.",4384,oe790p,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oe790p/no_one_seems_to_actually_know_what_a_smart/,neomatrix248,1625491236.0,False,FINANCE,t3_oe790p,False,665,False,0.95,"Smart contracts do not ensure payments went through, and they do not create decentralized casinos or banks.  In fact, they offer no guarantees about decentralization whatsoever.

They CAN be used for these things, but what they really are is much simpler.

Smart contracts are immutable scripts that exist on the blockchain.  They maintain a state (i.e. they store data) and they have functions that can be called.  That's it.

The only way to interact with a smart contract is to call one of its functions.  There are read-only functions that can be called on any Ethereum node to read some data out of the contract, and then there are functions you can call that modify data in some way, but those require sending a transaction and paying gas.

You can use this functionality to do many things, but it is important to note that they do NOT ensure anything.  You can write backdoors into smart contracts.  Smart contracts can have admins that have the ability to yoink all the funds out of it.  There are categories of bugs that allow a malicious smart contract to attack other smart contracts if they can get that contract to call one of their functions.  

Like all code, smart contracts can be written poorly or well.  The guarantees come from the implementation, not the nature of smart contracts themselves.  The same is true for banking software or other non-blockchain apps.

The key difference is that the code for smart contracts is (mostly) immutable.  Once they are deployed, the code cannot be changed.  However, there are some exceptions to note:

* Smart contracts can be written so that they are destroyed by calling a destructor function.  After that, the contract becomes invalid and can't be interacted with
* A smart contract can be modular and call other smart contracts.  You can ""upgrade"" one smart contract by deploying a new modular component and pointing the old contract to the new one with updated functionality.

Don't get caught up thinking that smart contracts are some amazing thing that solves all of our problems when it comes to creating safe, verified transactions.  They are just code, that's it.   People can still write shitty code.

EDIT: As others have pointed out, I'm speaking specifically about Ethereum smart contracts.  Other blockchains could have smart contracts with different properties, but I imagine they would be mostly similar."

They have done this in the past and some allege they are attempting to manipulate the market. Regardless of the intent, this just shows us we should always keep an eye on the data and metrics so we are not caught off guard with where the market heads. Crypto quant, Glassnode, Whale Alert, Willy Woo and Plan B are all great sources to give you ideas on future market moves. There's no reason to be emotional and in shock when these things happen. The beauty of having a public ledger is we can all track these transactions. Please just keep this in mind going forward. We have the tools to see what's going on ""behind the scenes"". Let's use them so we have better peace of mind in the future.

Edit: Thank you for the awards! 

Edit 2: PLEASE read the body and not just the headline. This isn't about blaming F2Pool, it's about letting people know we have tools to track transactions on the block chain so that we're not surprised by large market moves."

I get constant recommendations in my Youtube of this clickbaity fuckers, even though I have selected ""Don't show anymore"" on Youtube, but I guess it doesn't care. And lucky me...because Bitboy has released a video titled: ""My $10 Million Crypto Portfolio REVEALED (Shocking Holdings)"".

First of all, there is nothing shocking in your holdings, besides the amount of coins that you have already accepted a sponsor of and didn't disclose it, which is illegal.

And this got me thinking of some coins that he has proclaimed that have a ""100x"" potential, so I decided to watch the video, and see if he puts his money where is mouth is. (I only know where he puts his mouth in for those thumbnails)

Well Lo and Behold...that must be one of the biggest self exposes I have seen in a while.

He has SEVERAL videos titled something similar to: ""BEST Low Cap Crypto Gem of 2021"", and GUESS WHAT!! He doesn't hold 2/10 coins that he pumps in those videos. But he does hold 300k USD...hmmm, where has that come from?

I know that one of his sponsored videos was about SOUL, where he named it the BEST LOW CAP GEM, and HE DOESN'T OWN IT. This is more than proof that he dumps soon after his video airs.

Frontier...same thing...naming it the coin with the best potential he has seen, and it is only 0.4% of his portfolio??? Yeah right. See it for yourself if you are interested...

Just wanted to leave this information here. THIS IS PROOF THAT WHOEVER LISTENS TO BITBOY CRYPTO IS BEING SCAMMED. And if he was investigated...oh boy...oh boy, he would certainly use that 😱😮 face quite a bit in jail."

And today I noticed on the homepage that I reached 1 million trackers and ads blocked, which is pretty shocking. Additionally, I was essentially PAID to browse as I normally would -- with the recent run up in the price of BAT this amounts to \~$165. Obviously not a significant amount of money, but I think the concept is awesome regardless.

The browser itself works well, and the only issues I have with it are:

* You can only ""cash out"" via an Uphold wallet, which is KYC and has high fees.
* Some issues with receiving BAT payments on time.
* Can't enable BAT rewards on my iPhone, due to Apple's policy.

To those of you on the fence, I would suggest at least trying Brave. You can enable / disable BAT rewards (to earn BAT there are some pop-up ads that appear) as you please, so there's really no downside to giving it a shot. I think there are decent arguments on both sides about the value of the BAT token, so you can determine for yourself if enabling BAT ads are ""worth it"" for you.

A transfer from an external wallet/platform to GDAX appeared in all of our Coinbase accounts, and then said that it transferred successfully to our GDAX accounts, but then never showed up in our GDAX accounts. So it would appear our money is gone, because our balances are zero.  We’ve all opened tickets with support with absolutely no responses, posted on their subreddit, and called to only be on hold for hours without any help. I really don’t know what else to do except try to get us on the front page of a bigger crypto community.

More details about this issue are here https://www.reddit.com/r/CoinBase/comments/7mx88o/urgent_coinbase_to_gdax_transfer_disappeared/?st=JBUBPP35&sh=a19f1463

Thank you so much for your help to anybody who can spare an upvote to bring some attention to this.

If anybody from Coinbase finally wants to help, my support ticket number is 3221822

UPDATE: there’s a comment response from the Coinbase CEO, saying they’ll get to our tickets. Since I doubt they’ll respond again to me (and my balance is still 0 on GDAX so basically this whole issue was still not enough to fix our problem) - here’s my response:

What proof do I have that my coins are not lost? My balance on GDAX is 0, and my LTC balance on Coinbase is 0. This kind of thing should be a priority issue if people are getting balances of 0 on GDAX with an automatic send to their wallet transfer from Coinbase to GDAX like this. I’m even more frustrated that with 3.5k upvotes and a response, my LTC balance is still 0 from an error on their side.

One last clarification: I do not have any pending transfer issues (these I’m familiar with an have learned to wait). The transaction on the blockchain finished, the funds even appeared in my Coinbase account. The automatic transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (which has happened at least 5-10 times with no issues for me) this time withdrew the money from my Coinbase account and said the deposit to GDAX was completed. But my balance is 0 for LTC on Coinbase and 0 on GDAX, so this last move to GDAX (which is supposed to be instant, and says completed) zeroed my LTC balance. My balance has been 0 LTC for over 3 days now. This has nothing to do with their wire transfers, although I really feel for everyone still waiting on their withdrawals and hope they resolve that soon.

UPDATE: it’s been 4 days and still missing all of my LTC

UPDATE: 5 days now. No more holidays. I have no faith in crypto exchanges anymore.

6 days now. What a joke. I’ll post the next update in 6 months when my support ticket gets addressed and if I’m lucky they’ll fix our problem.

FINAL UPDATE: Fixed finally after 6 and a half days.  My account has been transferred the litecoin that were missing, thank you so much everyone on reddit for bringing attention to this. I really owe everyone because I had no power at all over this situation and I like to think this post helped get Coinbase to at least address this issue. It would appear others are still having problems with this Coinbase to GDAX transfer, or at least haven’t had their missing coins returned yet, just as an FYI. Thank you so much again everybody!!!!"

I later realized that a lot of people may not know the differences between a “coin” and a “token”, so I’m going to explain that here!

Let’s start off with what a blockchain even is! A blockchain is just software that is open source and distributed across many computers. These computers that run the blockchain software are considered “nodes”, and they keep track of the blockchain ledger, and any coins, tokens, and transactions associated with it.

The “coins” on the blockchain are just data (ones and zeroes) that is already written into the software. Using Bitcoin as an example, all 21 million Bitcoins are already in the Bitcoin software, and ownership of these coins is designated through the use of public and private keys, which gives the owners access to their Bitcoin on the blockchain. Also, with each new transaction block that is mined, new Bitcoins are awarded to the miners that processed these blocks. I touched on this whole process in my [previous](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mmltsq/why_do_we_have_coins_and_tokens_a_quick_primer/) post.

In other words, “coins” on a blockchain are just part of the software itself, and are there from it’s inception.

Tokens work a bit differently, in that they’re smart contracts that are deployed onto a blockchain, and are not innate to the blockchain software itself. Using Ethereum as an example, a token (such as an ERC-20 token), is something that a user creates, and deploys onto the blockchain software via smart contracts. When a token is added to the blockchain, the creator of the token is able to write the rules for how a token will work i.e. the max supply, tokenomics, burn rate, functions, etc. All of this is handled in the smart contract portion of it’s creation. Tokens do not have their own blockchain, so they have to abide by the rules of the governing blockchain i.e. Ethereum.

Hopefully this helps to explain the differences between a “coin” and a “token”!"

50 crypto terms you should know,4072,nh6lzx,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nh6lzx/50_crypto_terms_you_should_know/,Fantastic-Cucumber-1,1621532637.0,False,FINANCE,t3_nh6lzx,False,431,False,0.97,"If you're just getting started with crypto, or are struggling with all the terms that go around on this subreddit, this list is for you.

Behold the top 50 crypto terms you should know!

* **51% attack**

A 51% attack represents the situation where more than half of the computing power within a given blockchain of one person or one concentrated group. This ensures that this group gains full control over this blockchain. For example, they can stop all mining, stop all transactions or spend every coin of this specific blockchain infinitely often.

* **Address**

A cryptocoin address is the location where you store your crypto coins and from where you send and receive your coins. You could compare it with your home address. This address usually consists of a whole row of numbers and digits, which looks something like this: 1KXghhUZRVFmfk9Jreo3vvuV3HDoCJyYJZ. This address is the public part of the two encrypted keys (see private and public key) that are required for the holder to verify a transaction.

* **Airdrop**

This is a kind of giveaway for founders who determine a particular cryptocurrency, giving those coins or coins away. The promotion is for a short period. This is done to publicize the tokens and distribute the tokens.

* **Altcoin**

This name is used for all crypto coins that are not Bitcoin (alternative coins).

* **Altseason**

This is the term given when money flows to altcoins faster than Bitcoin. In other words, when investors buy more altcoins than Bitcoin.

* **AMA**

Ask me anything. A (mostly) new crypto project likes a session for users to ask them questions about the project. Reddit and Discord are often used for this.

* **AMM**

Automated Market Maker. That is to say, it is a kind of decentralized exchange platform (DEX). A mathematical formula is used to price assets. In a traditional exchange, it works differently, and assets are priced according to a price algorithm.

* **Arbitrage**

Buying and selling the same asset on two exchanges to take advantage of small price differences.

* **ASIC mining / miner**

ASIC stands for Application Specific Integrated Circuit. This is, in fact, a chip that is specially designed to perform one specific task. For this reason, thanks to ASIC mining, you can mine coins a lot faster than a regular computer or laptop could. For example, for Bitcoin, there are special ASIC miners who are only concerned with solving the SHA-256 algorithm. There are also crypto coins that are impossible to mine with an ASIC.

* **ATH**

ATH means All Time High. This is the highest price a cryptocurrency has ever achieved.

* **Bag**

A bag in the crypto world refers to the coins and tokens that you hold as part of your wallet. Typically, the term is used to describe a significant portion of a particular cryptocurrency. For example, a 'moon bag' is filled with the coins you currently own that you think will make you rich.

* **Bear market**

A bear knocks everything down with its claws. That is why a market where the trend is in a downward movement is called a bear market. Sentiment is then negative and prices predominantly fall.

* **Blockchain**

A blockchain is a kind of digital ledger of transactions that works from a decentralized network. Thanks to cryptography, a ledger can be kept by a large number of computers that together create the network. Every time a new transaction is made, it is added by the miners with date, size, etc. to the blockchain as a new block.

* **Block**

The blocks are the ""pages"" in the digital ledger of the blockchain. These are files with immutable data that are permanently stored on the blockchain.

* **Block reward**

The block reward is the reward that miners receive for finding a mathematical solution related to that block. With Bitcoin, this reward is 25 Bitcoins per mined block. This halves every 210,000 blocks.

* **BTFD**

Buy the f \* cking dip! This term is used when the price of a cryptocurrency or the market is in a dip. People are inclined to leave because they are afraid of losing. But a dip offers opportunities to buy a coin or token cheaply before it starts to rise again.

* **Buy the Dip**

Same as BTFD only without the expletives.

* **Bull market**

A bull stabs its horns and throws you up. That is why a Bull Market is a market where the trend is in an upward movement. Prices are rising and sentiment is positive.

* **Cold storage**

Cryptocurrency is stored “offline”. You do this if you want to safely store coins for a longer period of time. A hardware wallet is an example of cold storage.

* **Cryptography**

Also called secret writing. This focuses on techniques for hiding or encrypting information to be sent so that it is impossible for anyone accessing the channel on which it is sent to find out what information was sent.

* **Cryptocurrency**

A kind of digital currency based on cryptography. This concerns both Bitcoin and other altcoins.

* **DAO**

A DAO is a ""decentralized autonomous organization"" and can be described as an open source blockchain protocol governed by a set of rules, created by its elected members, that automatically perform certain actions without the intervention of intermediaries.

* **dApps**

These are decentralized applications (dApps) are digital applications or programs that exist and run on a blockchain or P2P network of computers rather than a single computer, and are beyond the reach and control of a single authority.

* **DeFi - Decentralized Finance**

DeFi, or decentralized financing, is a new way to conduct financial transactions through applications. It excludes traditional financial institutions and intermediaries and is run through the blockchain. Think of it as removing brokers, exchanges, banks and other middlemen from the equation.

* **DEX**

A DEX is a Decentralized Exchange or a decentralized exchange. Decentralized exchanges are a type of cryptocurrency exchange that allows direct peer-to-peer cryptocurrency transactions to take place online securely and without an intermediary. No identification is required at these exchanges.

* **Distributed & Central Ledger**

A distributed ledger is an agreement of shareable, shared, and synchronized data, which in this case is spread across several networks. These networks are then distributed over many computers.

With a central ledger, the synchronized and shareable data is controlled by one network or individual.

* **Double Spending**

This means that a particular cryptocoin can be spent more than once. This stops the blockchain from working.

* **Dust Transaction**

A transaction of extremely few coins that represents almost no value, but takes up space on the blockchain.

* **ECDSA**

Elliptic Curve Digitial Signature Algorithm is a lightweight cryptographic algorithm used to sign transactions on the Bitcoin protocol.

* **ERC20 token**

An ERC20 token is in some ways comparable to Bitcoin, Litecoin and any other cryptocurrency; these tokens are assets based on blockchain technology. They have value and you can send and receive them. ERC20 tokens are only issued on the Ethereum network.

* **Escrow**

A concept in which financial assets are held by a third party to protect them during an asynchronous transaction.

* **Fiat money**

Currencies that were once backed by gold (golden standard). Currently it only has value because people value it.

* **FOMO**

""Fear Of Missing Out"". This often occurs when a cryptocurrency increases in value so quickly that people are afraid that they will miss the boat to riches, causing the price per coin to be even higher.

* **FUD**

""Fear, Uncertainty, Doubt"". This crypto term is often used to describe the volatility of the crypto market.

* **Fork (branch / split)**

A fork happens when an alternate operational version of the current blockchain separates permanently. This can be done in three different ways:

* By a 51% attack
* Because there is a bug in the program
* Because new substantial changes have to be made to the current blockchain.
* **Genesis block**

The block mined first in a blockchain

* **Halving**

This means that the minable reward (see block reward) is halved. This happens every time with a certain amount of mined blocks. With Bitcoin, for example, this is for every 210,000 blocks.

* **Hash**

A mathematical process that takes a variable number of data as input and produces a shorter result of a fixed length.

* **Hashrate**

This is the speed at which the math problems for certain blocks can be solved. In other words, the speed at which a new block can be discovered. ASIC mining, for example, causes the hash rate to go down.

* **HODL**

Originally 'Hold' was meant, but in a tipsy mood a chat participant kept talking about how he was 'hodling' his coins. This quickly became a meme and now it has become established in the crypto world and means holding onto your crypto coins for the long term. Sometimes it also refers to 'Hold on for dear life'.

* **ICO**

Stands for Initial Coin Offering. This is a form of crowdfunding, where the public can invest in a blockchain startup in advance. As a thank you for the financial support they are rewarded with a certain amount of coins.

* **IEO**

This is an Initial exchange offer. It is a variant of Initial Coin Offerings (ICO), managed directly by cryptocurrency exchanges.

* **KYC**

This stands for 'Know Your Customer'. It refers to the verification process that customers must go through to verify their identity and associate it with a cryptocurrency wallet. Crypto exchanges gain a better understanding of the potential client's activities and can determine whether or not they are legal in nature. A legal requirement for many central exchanges (CEX) to admit customers to their fair.

* **Mining**

Mining is the crypto term used to search for new block rewards. For finding and solving blocks, a reward is given to the miner.

* **Moon**

When a cryptocurrency ""goes to the moon,"" it means people think its price will rise exponentially.

* **Multisig (multiple signatures)**

Multisignature is a form of technology that ensures that extra security is added to Bitcoin transactions. Multisiganature addresses require another user to sign the transaction before it can be added to the blockchain.

* **NFT**

An NFT is a Non-fungible Token. They are unique and cannot be exchanged. They live on the blockchain.

* **Node**

A node is a computer connected to the crypto network that uses a client tasked with validating and tracing transactions. Each node receives a copy of the current blockchain, which is automatically downloaded when it joins the Bitcoin network.

* **P2P**

This stands for peer-to-peer. A (crypto) term that refers to computers that directly build a network with each other without a central server in between.

* **Privacy coin**

These are a class of cryptocurrencies that enable private and anonymous blockchain transactions by obscuring their origin and destination. Some of the techniques used include hiding a user's real wallet balance and address, and combining multiple transactions to circumvent chain analysis. Examples are Monero (XMR) and Zcash (ZEC).

* **Private key**

A string of letters and numbers that is kept secret by the user. It is specially designed to sign a digital transfer using a public key. In the case of Bitcoin, this is a private key that must work with a public key.

* **Public key**

A string of letters and numbers that is public and can be viewed by anyone. This can be used in combination with a private key to sign a digital transaction.

* **Pump and Dump**

This is a crypto term used for the unethical process of pumping and dumping a relatively cheap coin. The coin is first obtained in a very cheap way by a certain group of persons who then ""pump"" the coin (make its value rise sharply) by advertising it a lot. When the coin has appreciated enough, they dump their coins with a lot of profit, leaving a large group at a loss.

* **PoW**

Stands for Proof-of-Work. This is a system that links computing power with mining capacity. The more powerful your computer can mine, the more you will be rewarded for this.

* **PoS**

Stands for Proof-of-Stake. This is a system that links the interest in a particular crypto coin to the mining capacity. This means that the more tokens you own of a particular crypto coin, the more you can mine this coin.

The PoW and the PoS are both consensus algorithms. With this mechanism you can organize as a user, but also machines, in a distributed environment. All agents, the nodes of a blockchain, must agree on a single source of truth. Even if some of the nodes fail. This means that the system must be fault tolerant.

* **DPos**

Stands for Delegated Proof-of-Stake. This is a variant of Proof of Stake that uses supernodes or masternodes to approve transactions.

* **Scam coin**

A coin created for the sole purpose of making the creator of this coin rich (usually through pump and dump).

Often this is accompanied by a Pyramid scheme. A pyramid scheme is a business model that recruits members through a promise of payments or services to enroll others in the scheme, rather than providing investment or selling products.

* **SHA-256**

The cryptographic algorithm used for Bitcoin's PoW system.

* **Signature**

A signature is a mathematical process by which someone can prove that he / she is the owner of his / her wallet. For example, a ""private key"" is used.

* **Smart Contract**

A two-way smart contract is an immutable agreement that is recorded on the blockchain, containing specific logical actions that are comparable to a ""normal"" contract. Once this contract has been signed, it can never be changed again. A smart contract can be used to set certain benchmarks that must be met in exchange for money.

* **Wallet**

See ""address""

* **Whale**

A whale is someone or a company that owns a large percentage of a particular crypto coin. It is often the case that a whale can also manipulate the price of this crypto coin.

* **Whitepaper**

A document that describes in detail the protocol of the crypto currency.

* **Yield Farming**

Yield farming, this is also known as liquidity mining. This allows you to generate a way for rewards with cryptocurrency holdings. In simple terms, this means locking cryptocurrencies and receiving rewards. This happens on DeFi projects.

How do smart contracts work? And what are they good for? I'll try to answer these questions in this post.

## What are smart contracts?

A smart contract is an agreement between two or more parties in the form of computer code. The contracts are stored on the blockchain and cannot be changed. Transactions that take place in a smart contract are processed by the blockchain, which means they can be sent automatically without the intervention of a third party. When you enter into an agreement with a smart contract, no confidential advisor is required. The transactions only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

## What can smart contracts do?

Smart contracts help you exchange money, stock or anything else of value in a transparent, trustless manner, all while avoiding the services of an intermediary and the possibility of conflict. Smart contracts provide you:

* Autonomy - You are the one who makes the deal and you don't have to rely on an intermediary to confirm transactions. The execution is automatically managed by a decentralized network, which excludes manipulation of contracts.
* Speed ​​- Automated contracts can save you hours on manual paperwork.
* Security - Smart contracts are secured with similar cryptography that encrypts websites. In short, it keeps your documents safe.
* Savings - Because they disable the presence of an intermediary, smart contracts can save you a lot of money. Where, for example, you would normally have to pay a notary to witness your transaction, this is now regulated by the blockchain.
* Backup - Unlike files on your computer, data on the blockchain is duplicated many times over. So you do not have to be afraid of losing something that is registered on the blockchain. Also, there is no way anyone can say they lost the contract or the dog ate it.

## A smart contract in effect

As an example; If you were to register cinema tickets on the blockchain using a smart contract, then as a visitor you will receive the tickets in your personal wallet. You only have to show the address to which the tickets were sent upon entry and the cinema can immediately be sure that you do not have any fake tickets and that you have actually paid for your tickets. This gives a better customer experience and the cinema can save a lot of costs in this way because it no longer needs ticket processing services.

## But why is this so safe?

Thanks to blockchain technology, we can decentralize smart contracts so that they are fair and trusted. Decentralization means that they are not controlled by one central party, such as a bank or the government.

The blockchain is a shared database managed by many different computers (nodes). As a result, not one person or company has control over it. It also means that it is almost impossible to hack it and therefore smart contracts can be executed securely and automatically without anyone being able to change them.

## Best practices for smart contracts

In principle, smart contracts can be used for any type of transaction, it does not have to be financial. Here are some industries where smart contracts can be used conveniently.

## Insurances

The insurance world could be shaken up considerably by blockchain technology. An example of a smart contract was a project run by a French insurance company called AXA. AXA offered flight insurance that were paid out if the policyholder's flight was delayed by more than two hours. AXA was running a pilot project that payed out insurance via smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. Unfortunately the project has been discontinued.

The smart contract worked with an “if / then function”: IF the flight was delayed by more than two hours, THEN the policyholder would be paid. Because the smart contract was connected to a database that keeps track of flight times, the function could be performed automatically and paid for via the Ethereum blockchain. This would have saved a lot of time for AXA, but also for the policyholder. This is just one example of the many options that smart contracts offer.

## Healthcare

Within healthcare, smart contracts will be used to record and securely transfer data. We can already see examples of smart contracts used in the medical industry, such as the company Encrypgen, for example. This is an application that uses blockchain to transfer patient data in a secure manner, eliminating the need for third-party access. In this way, the patients are in control of their own data. If researchers want to use patient data, they have to pay for it. The patient also chooses whether the data may be sold or not.

## Governments

Governments guarantee that it is extremely difficult to manipulate the voting system, but despite that, smart contracts could alleviate all concerns by providing an infinitely more secure system. Smart contracts could also prevent low voter turnout. Much of the small turnout is due to a clunky system consisting of lining up a queue, showing your identity, and filling out forms. With the use of smart contracts, anyone can transfer their votes securely online, which is expected to generate much more response.

## Business management

There is still a lot of room for improvement within business management and smart contracts can help a lot. Why do administration when everything is registered on the blockchain anyway? Right, the blockchain is already doing the work for you. You also do not have to make a pay slip every month. The money automatically goes to your employees as soon as they have fulfilled the agreements. Companies can simply set up a smart contract that states: IF the date is 10/20/2020, THEN $2500 will be sent to employee A. This means that employees will always be paid on time and that they will never be underpaid. The advantage of the company is that it is all automated, saving them a lot of time and money!

## Fundraising (ICOs)

In principle, anyone could create their own token and sell it to the general public in order to raise money for a project. In 2017 there was a real ICO craze, where some projects managed to raise tens of millions within hours. There was even an EOS ICO that lasted for a year and racked up more than $ 4 billion in total!

If you want to organize an ICO (Initial Coin Offering) you create a token and a contract to sell the token. The function of the smart contract in this case would be: if person A sends an X amount of ETH, person A gets an X amount of tokens.

## Smart contracts in a nutshell

The most important features of a smart contract are:

* Digital Agreement - A smart contract is an agreement in the form of computer code.
* Blockchain - Transactions are processed by a public database, based on blockchain technology.
* Confidentiality - A transaction can only take place if the conditions in the agreement are met.

## Conclusion

It will be a while before smart contracts are everywhere in everyday life, but we can say with some certainty that the technology has a lot to offer.

I hope this post helped you with:

* Getting a better understanding of smart contracts
* Understanding the significance of smart contracts within the crypto space.

"As a Security Analyst here are some tips I’ve learned from my line of work to keep you, your computer, and your crypto safe.",4039,mv3bqe,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mv3bqe/as_a_security_analyst_here_are_some_tips_ive/,xCryptoPandax,1618961363.0,True,SECURITY,t3_mv3bqe,False,696,False,0.98,"I currently work within a fortune 100 company’s Computer Security Incident Response Team as a security analyst. 

As more and more newbies jump in the field, I wanted to share some security tips outside the typical “not your keys, not your wallet” type security as there’s other ways to be hit

1.) [haveibeenpwned.com](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) enter your email and see what data breaches your email(s) have been apart of. I recently helped a fellow reddit user who said his account was hacked, turns out he was part of a breach where a crypto site was hacked and his password was exposed, he reused this password on another crypto site that the attacker crossed referenced with his email / pass from the other site and didn’t have 2FA activated.

With that don’t reuse passwords, and use auto generated passwords / store them in a encrypted password manager (I use [KeePass](https://keepass.info/))

2.) Every single program/software is essentially a attack vector, keep your OS updated, keep your software updated, and uninstall ANY thing you don’t use anymore. Just look up the SolarWinds hack and see how supply chain attacks work.

3.) Don’t download random stuff from this site or any other. If you want to, check the hash of the software. This can be done using “Certutil -hashfile ‘filename’ sha256” in the windows cmd (Linux you can use “sha256sum ‘filename’”) you can then enter the hash into [VirusTotal.com](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/home/search) to see if it comes back malicious.

4.) Keeping your seed phrase safe, I personally store it in a KeePass database file (encrypted) then put that file on 2 USB drives and store it in 2 different secure locations.

5.) typical advice: Don’t engage reddit messages, don’t disclose your portfolio, cold wallets, and activate 2FA on your reddit account to keep your moons safe.

EDIT: 

6.) Don’t trust email links, I’ve actually worked with the owner of haveibeenpwned owned on a “breach” I found where I found over 12K emails that were entered into phishing sites, and reported it to him. Always go to the site directly through the url address (and double check it)

7.) ALSO! Forgot one of the most important ones, chrome extensions, these can have keyloggers, take screenshots, and track you. It might not be malicious when you downloaded it, but attackers generally 
 update them with malicious code with those capabilities or aren’t updated at all which leads to potential unfixed vulnerabilities. Double check the ones you have installed, and remove any you don’t need.

8.) VPN / Browser, use a vpn with a no log policy to encrypt your network traffic. I personally use ProtonVPN and it’s worth the few bucks a month for a paid version, brave also allows you to use TOR in browser. Another option is hardening Firefox to use as a browser if brave doesn’t suite your needs which a guide can be found [here](https://informinc.org/internet/how-to-harden-your-firefox-browser-for-security-and-privacy/)

EDIT EDIT:
I’ve gotten a lot of messages regarding how to get into the Cybersecurity field and trying my best to respond to them, if there’s interest I could make a post about that at some point. 

If so please feel free to leave questions below, that you would like answered in case it doesn’t come to mind when writing it / trying my best to respond."
CMC just tumbled the whole market with one move by excluding Korean exchanges from price calculations,4034,7oxivj,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7oxivj/cmc_just_tumbled_the_whole_market_with_one_move/,dzigizord,1515404806.0,False,TRADING,t3_7oxivj,False,1062,False,0.92,"Few hours ago Coin Market Cap removed Korean exchanges from their coin price calculations and being that all coins are about 30% pricier over there, it instantly tanked the price on CMC graphs. From what I see this is happening now : 

1. CMC removed Korean exchanges
2. Prices/graphs instantly tanked (but in practice not relevant to people outside Korea who dont trade there anyhow)
3. Large number of people did not recognize what actually happened and that there were not moves/selling on their western exchanges
4. Those same people are now dumping large amount of coins trying to ""cut loses"" because of the false impression that coin is crashing.
5. Random stuff happening

My opinion is that this should have been handled much better by CMC. At least put a banner saying ""WE HAVE EXCLUDED KOREAN EXCHANGES BECAUSE OF THIS OR THAT AND IT WILL HAVE SUCH INFLUENCE ON CALCULATIONS"". I just hope they do not put back and remove those exchanges at random point in time. Any thoughts?"

Not because I'm a lazy noob, but because I'm humble enough to recognize I won't be able to understand a lot of what they say.",4026,mgzdxw,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/mgzdxw/i_stopped_reading_whitepapers_not_because_im_a/,Cool-Might7913,1617170190.0,False,,t3_mgzdxw,False,606,False,0.89,"Probably gonna get downvoted to oblivion, so you could consider this reverse moon farming. Anyways, before anybody discredits me, I am studying Computer Science and have been able to land some nice internships, so yes, I admit that I'm not an expert and there are many things I don't know, however I would consider myself someone that has been exposed to basic Computer Science concepts, and more advanced ones in Algorithms, Data Structures and Cryptography.

With that out of the way, I just wanted to say that there are a lot of people here giving recommendations to new people (which is great) and there is this specific one that really irks me, ""Read the whitepaper"". Why does it annoy me so much?

* Well, for starters I highly doubt that people giving these recommendations even read the whitepapers themselves, I honestly believe that they say this in order to look like ""responsible investors"" or ""being in it for the tech"", whatever their motives are, I believe that 99% are lying.
* For the tiny minority that actually reads the whitepapers, I don't mean to sound like an asshole, but I highly doubt you understand the important technical part of the whitepapers completely. I say this because I've taken several high level CS courses in college and I struggle every time to grasp some concepts that describe how a certain project works and what makes it significant. I am certainly no guru, but I believe that I know more CS than the vast majority of people who are trying to get into crypto, and if someone like me can't understand what these whitepapers say, how exactly will a newcomer get any benefit from trying to read these documents?

You know, I remember I got into crypto right when I started college, and even now 3 years later, I prefer just watching a simplified video about a project than trying to read the whitepaper, which I know will be a waste of time. There is a reason why most projects upload a simplified version that explains how the project works, and that's so that newcomers can get an idea of what the project is. Odds are that the vast majority of people trying to buy a certain cryptocurrency will be people that just don't have the background required to understand whitepapers, so let's stop recommending them to read whitepapers and instead recommend them something different, like watching videos or reading simplified articles that explain what the cryptocurrency that they want to buy is."

"Anyone interested in setting up a protest in NYC TONIGHT, to protest the crypto provision in the infrastructure bill? We need boots on the ground!",3997,p10wy3,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/p10wy3/anyone_interested_in_setting_up_a_protest_in_nyc/,HenryfromCC,1628513801.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_p10wy3,False,789,False,0.91,"**(See update at bottom)**

I think we should start a protest outside the NYSE building, at 11 Wall Street. 

If this post can get enough momentum then we can make it happen. This sub has more than enough Americans in it to have a huge ass protest that the media can’t ignore. (It might be worth mentioning that I don’t care about moons—I don’t have my vault set up and don’t plan on using them for anything.) 

We just need more than phone calls and emails if we want to make a difference. 

And we CAN make a difference.

When Kratom was up for a federal ban, a much smaller number of people protested and were able to reverse the federal ban. 

If we push and are organized in our messaging, we CAN win!

The alternative is frankly unthinkable. 

I’ve been working on a crypto project related to climate change and impact investing… and these reporting requirements will crush that dream before I can even get it off the ground. 

In fact, if this passes, I’ll probably end up having to rescind my citizenship and move to a more crypto friendly jurisdiction to work on my project.

And I’m not the only one who will do this. 

So… rather than let that happen I’m willing to whatever I can to prevent this from going through. 

And I’m thinking a physical protest at Wall Street could be a good play. We have a strong narrative here:

Janet Yellen and her corrupt banking cronies are working the system to push this through. Any Senator that supports this hates the average crypto investor, wants to drive innovation abroad, and is probably in bed financially with the big banks. 

We can push that last point particularly hard. 

Make this issue completely toxic for these senators and make them start to second guess their positions at the CRITICAL hour. 

If we can get enough people willing to commit… then let’s do it. 

I think it would have to be later TODAY, given how soon they are voting. 

Anyone else interested in setting this up?

Edit: obviously this is a peaceful protest, and you should only attend if you are peaceful and are capable of remaining calm in protest situations.

Edit 2: if you’re not in the US and cannot physically attend, you can still help us promote the protest. All we need are for a few higher profile crypto people to get on board and do a few tweets… and then we can make this a real thing. 

Please reach out to crypto influencers on Twitter and ask them to support a impromptu peaceful protest targeting the crypto provision. I would do this myself, but I’ve been banned from Twitter. 

It doesn’t need to be just NYC. Ideally we can get people in dc to organize an event as well.

If we work TOGETHER we CAN overcome this!

**Edit #3: Thanks everyone for being awesome and supporting this on such short notice!** 

I originally didn’t include a time because I wasn’t sure if the post would get enough traction to hold an actual event. But now it seems like we might be able to at least get a small crowd to protest, and anything is better than nothing. 

If you want to help but aren’t in the US, you can still do so by promoting the demonstrations on Twitter. Use #YeetYellen and target crypto influencers so we can get them on board with promoting the event. Someone else here came up with #BLOCCUPYWALLSTREET which isn’t half bad either. 

**Here are the details**:

**If you’re in or near NYC, then show up outside the NYSE at 11 Wall Street at 6:30 pm, and depending on how things go, we’ll stick around until 8:30**

**If you’re in or near DC, then show up at the lawn facing the Washington Memorial (on 1st st NW) at 6:30, and plan on being there for around 2 hours** 

One thing needs to be very clear: While it’s more than likely I’ll end up holding a silent one-man vigil… if we do manage to get any sort of numbers, we have to be very careful to monitor for plants and paid agitators. It would be very easy for Wall Street to coordinate with the media to paint any sort of protest like this as unruly or violent. 

If you see any bad behavior, such as violence or vandalism or even just people acting weirdly outrageous and trying to speak on behalf of the crowd, etc., take your phone out and start filming. If police come to make an arrest or intervene, let them do their job and don’t interfere. 

**If someone starts acting up, start filming and make sure to BOO the agitators LOUDLY, so that small clips cannot be taken out of context to portray the crowd in a negative light**

**Update**

So here’s what happened for everyone that’s interested.

I showed up at the NYSE at around 6:20 with a cardboard sign that read “Vote 4 Toomey-Warner-Loomis U.C.” 

6:30 comes around and it’s still just me. So I wait patiently for digital allies to show up. 

Now granted… the NYSE area is a bit confusing and the building has two sides on it so people might have gotten tripped up on that. 

But there was one brave soul who showed up after seeing the post on Reddit. And to that person, I will be eternally grateful.

I did manage to chat up the security guard at the NYSE for quite a bit of time and he was a pretty cool dude and seemed to agree that the new regulations were ridiculous. 

Whoever commented about the other random dude protesting at the NYSE was spot on… there was another guy there with a sign that read “This is a death cult”, who claimed the be the originator of the occupy Wall Street movement. 

I tried to stay away from him but he seemed intent on making it a dueling-signs type situation… and eventually he started shouting and ranting about how bad cryptocurrency was and eventually I lost my cool and sort of cursed him out. He was provoking me… but I still feel bad about it, especially since he left right after. But it is what it is. 

I stayed there holding my sign until around 8:15. 

In truth, I wanted to leave when no one showed up, but since you all showed me so much love and support… and were with me in ‘spirit’…I felt obligated to stay strong and hold the vigil."
Just a quick reminder why Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency was invented in the first place.,3990,nlu2fu,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nlu2fu/just_a_quick_reminder_why_bitcoincryptocurrency/,BTC_Hadzija,1622070603.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_nlu2fu,False,713,False,0.97," 

* People used to pay each other in gold and silver. Difficult to transport. Difficult to divide.
* Paper money was invented. A claim to gold in a bank vault. Easier to transport and divide.
* Banks  gave out more paper money than they had gold in the vault. They ran  “fractional reserves”. A real money maker. But every now and then, banks  collapsed because of runs on the bank.
* Central  banking was invented. Central banks would be lenders of last resort.  Runs on the bank were thus mitigated by banks guaranteeing each other’s  deposits through a central bank. The risk of a bank run was not lowered.  Its frequency was diminished and its impact was increased. After all,  banks remained basically insolvent in this fractional reserve scheme.
* Banks  would still get in trouble. But now, if one bank got in sufficient  trouble, they would all be in trouble at the same time. Governments  would have to step in to save them.
* All  ties between the financial system and gold were severed in 1971 when  Nixon decided that the USD would no longer be exchangeable for a fixed  amount of gold. This exacerbated the problem, because there was now  effectively no limit anymore on the amount of paper money that banks  could create.
* From  this moment on, all money was created as credit. Money ceased to be  supported by an asset. When you take out a loan, money is created and  lent to you. Banks expect this freshly minted money to be returned to  them with interest. Sure, banks need to keep adequate reserves. But  these reserves basically consist of the same credit-based money. And  reserves are much lower than the loans they make.
* This  led to an explosion in the money supply. The Federal Reserve stopped  reporting M3 in 2006. But the ECB currently reports a yearly increase in  the supply of the euro of about 5%.
* This  leads to a yearly increase in prices. The price increase is somewhat  lower than the increase in the money supply. This is because of  increased productivity. Society gets better at producing stuff cheaper  all the time. So, in absence of money creation you would expect prices  to drop every year. That they don’t is the effect of money creation.
* What remains is an inflation rate in the 2% range.
* Banks  have discovered that they can siphon off all the productivity increase +  2% every year, without people complaining too much. They accomplish  this currently by increasing the money supply by 5% per year, getting  this money returned to them at an interest.
* Apart  from this insidious tax on society, banks take society hostage every  couple of years. In case of a financial crisis, banks need bailouts or  the system will collapse.
* Apart  from these problems, banks and governments are now striving to do away  with cash. This would mean that no two free men would be able to  exchange money without intermediation by a bank. If you believe that to  transact with others is a fundamental right, this should scare you.
* The  absence of sound money was at the root of the problem. We were  force-fed paper money because there were no good alternatives. Gold and  silver remain difficult to use.
* When it was tried to launch a private currency backed by precious metals  (Liberty dollar), this initiative was shut down because it undermined  the U.S. currency system. Apparently, a currency alternative could only  thrive if “nobody” launched it and if they was no central point of  failure.
* What  was needed was a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. This was what  Satoshi Nakamoto described in 2008. It was a response to all the  problems described above. That is why he labeled the genesis block with  the text: “03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for  banks.”. Bitcoin was meant to be an alternative to our current financial  system.

So, if you find  yourself religiously checking some cryptocurrency’s price, or bogged  down in discussions about the “one true bitcoin”, or constantly asking  what currency to buy, please at least remember that we have bigger fish to fry.

We are here to fix the financial system."

Here’s a reminder for y’all lurkers here or a wake up call for people who actually take the time of day to shitpost:

1. Nobody who’s even close to being a big player or is knowledgeable about the market is wasting their time on fucking r/cryptocurrency 

2. Most “advice” you get on here is from hodlboys or plain shills trying to jerk their own dicks by echoing the same copy paste moon statements. By the occasional mercy of god there’s a post that makes life worth living but those are usually rare. This post is also not one of them.

3. No you won’t get rich hodling a mass shilled top 100 coin for a week, a month, maybe a year. Jesus Christ if it took early bitcoin miners years to go from a couple hundred to almost 20k you won’t make it with a short term focus.

4. Putting a couple hundred or thousand dollars does not make you an “investor” or at all knowledgeable about blockchain. Losing your money sucks learn from mistakes instead of dragging others down. 

5. Comments that say “3k next it’s over boys” with 30 upvotes does NOT legitimize that claim, assume it’s 31 idiots sharing a herd mentality with no basis for their arbitrary prediction.

6. Anything that has to do with price on r/cryptocurrency should not be taken as financial advice. Nobody on this sub actually know which way the markets will turn, TA works in very niche circumstances and cannot predict movements based around obvious facts or fundamental trends.

That’s all I have to say for now, my fingers are tired. I’ve been in the space for some years now and this sub is a place I frequent despite all the cancerous shit I see daily. The memes are fucking comedy gold and I will always love you guys for being here with me.

TL;DR do your own fucking research and don’t listen to anyone announcing the direction this market is heading.

EDIT: Some people apparently are not seeing the point of this post or get some kind of joy mocking if. Allow me to make some things clear:

No I’m not angry or have any personal salt nor am I projecting my expectations of what this sub SHOULD be but rather I’m only letting people know what this sub IS at the moment and what to be wary for. I was once new to the space and foolishly trusted the advice stemming from fickle sentiments and made mistakes doing so. All I hope to achieve with this post is for people to realize that this is not the place for accurate predictions regarding market movement and to be careful, That’s all.

EDIT 2: Thanks for gold. It is currently too difficult to respond to the sheer volume of comments thus I am unable to  answer every new question that gets posted, sorry."

These are places where authorities are able to have a detailed look at your holdings and even have the possibility to confiscate your holdings or block you for whatever reason they have. Being the only person who has  complete control over your own crypto assets was and is the main argument for crypto and the ultimate form of freedom. There’re already existing KYC/AML rules on exchanges which is fair enough, but forcing people to get rid of their private wallets is outrageous!

By removing liquidity and not selling, he's effectively selling without 'selling'. This way he doesn't have to tell the community that he sold while they all bought, he just has to hold his initial promise of keeping 1m of usdc liquidity

He even holds all the liquidity in a 1% fee position so he can syphon out 1% of all the volume!

In total he has his uni liquidity + 1m USDC extracted so far

This is outright theft

I'm pro defi, community should call it out when we can, don't need law enforcement but this guy is cutting himself close:

* California citizen
* Doxxed
* Clearly a security
* All actions on chain
* Telling people do 1 thing as he does another

In short, he literally rugs his own community (as a millionaire). **There are** legal implication for this.

#The Elation  
For me, I kept talking to my good friend M about Bitcoin. He told me about it in September and through October to November we watched it sail past $10,000, to $15,000 before we decided to dip our toes. He was dead set on Ripple and bought at about $0.20, and was supposed to come over and show me how to set it up, but on his way over, he was T-boned by a careless driver and we postponed it. In the days after, Ripple shot up and I felt like I missed the boat, and he tipped me off about another good project called ""Cardano""  

*Oh, those merry times*  

I bought some in mid December, and let me tell you that what happened was absolutely insane. For starters, Coinbase was so fucked from the insane level of sign ups, that they couldn't process new accounts. It took **THREE WEEKS** for my account to be verified, and I had to buy Bitcoin from Local Bitcoins, transfer to Binance and then swap to Cardano. What a joke, but hey I got my Cardano. Little did we realise, we were just 1 month from the top. We enjoyed stratospheric gains for one month.  

It felt different than this February, where gains have been ridiculous. Back then, you could've put your money on nearly anything and 8-10x'd in a couple weeks flat. Someone on this reddit described it really well - your money doubled, then doubled again. You'd think ""Surely this is it"", then it doubled again. Finally, it doubled again. And then once more.  

I bought 2 days before the Bitcoin top. I had no idea what happens next.  

For the unaware, alts don't really go up when BTC goes up. Money flows out of alts, into BTC as it gains. When BTC dips, it takes the market with it. But BTC rising up doesn't really take the market up because there are so many who take money out of alts to ride BTC's wave. **The best time to be in alts, is when BTC goes flat**  

And that's kinda what happened. And alts exploded.  

My small Cardano buy doubled, and then doubled, and again and again. Every day I woke up to more green in the portfolio. My mate was making bank off Ripple - it went from 20c to over $3.00. I cursed myself for not just buying Ripple at 44c or whatever it was, and I bought some at $3.15 - basically the top of the market, Ripple's highest ever price.  

I also bought some bags. FunFair went mad, why not, I'll have some. Saw crazy profit on that. ETHLend going mad? Go on then. TRON? Go on then!  

There was no wrong decision in that frenzy.  

Until there was.  

#The Copium  
The gains leveled out. Some days started to get red. Everyone was saying shit like ""Chinese New Year"", ""Wall Street Bonuses"", ""Korea FUD"". Nobody can pin why the bubble popped, but in any assets history, such an incredible period of growth just cannot be sustained. I think it was South Korea basically taking some exchanges offline and it fucked with Coin Stat websites. People panicked and sold. That caused more panic, and more sales.  

The daily gains turned red, very quickly.  

""It's just a dip"" ""Hold!"" ""We need a correction"" was the hopium of the day. Anyone ballsy enough sold, probably everyone who had been in this space since 2016. They'd seen it all before.  

Some coins slowly turned from green, to breakeven, to red.  

And it just kept going down. I remember a brief rally in April. It was a suckers rally, in May my altcoins were mostly back in profit. It went down again. Same thing in August, BTC spiked up, we all thought ""Finally, this is it!"" and then it came back down again. Over and over.

Small blips aside, the Bitcoin bear market lasted from Mid December 2018 to Mid March 2020. That's 15 months, and only then did it start rising properly. We had a false start in early 2019 after the babyish chain split of Bitcoin Cash into BCH and BSV, which plummeted the market into one of the lowest prolonged periods of red I have seen. At this point, many people were down some -80% to -95%, me included.  

#The Effect  
How did it feel? Well to be honest, weird. But it happened over such a long period of time, you just become numb to it. In fact, after periods where your portfolio barely moves 3% in a week, you actually come to enjoy the wild volatility, even when the arse is falling out of it.  

It never stops though, in October 2018, we experienced one of the sharpest in memory, when a childish squabble between Roger Ver and Craig Wright forked the Bitcoin Cash chain into BCH and Bitcoin ""Satoshi's Vision"" (christ)  

This resulted in an absolutely gut-wrenching drop which lasted until early 2019.  

Some days, the losses and gains really did affect my day to day. I've received a couple warnings from work about chart-watching and I've been snappy or elated depending on how much I lost or gained in a day. Now I just truly don't care. I have a target and if I get there, good, if not, I'll wait.

#Is that a light I see?  
2019 started out quite nicely. Price remained stable in the $3,000's until April, where it all started climbing back up again. Alts came along for the ride too. On the summer solstice, BTC broke past $10,000. I smiled as I checked my portfolio, the same day I proposed to my gorgeous fiancee *(that covers my ass in case she reads this)*. Were things looking up?  

Myeh, not quite. This period of >$10,000 lasted until about September and we came back down. Again, a quiet Christmas and then the hope of a new year brought prices up again just nosing past $10,000.  

Up to this point, I had been buying a bunch of stuff. I bought some Golem, it tripled in one of those spikes in 2018 and then I held a worthless token. My ETHLend, Funfair and Tron were basically worthless. The only times I was in profit was when Cardano, Eth or Ripple stirred from their sleep.  

My first Bitcoin buy, to actually buy and keep, was in fuckin November 2019. I set up a monthly buy, but then stopped halfway through 2020 - with Coronavirus, I could've been out of work at a moments notice so all crypto buying stopped.  

In March 2020, we saw Crypto nosedive as Coronavirus struck. This one sucked. In hindsight, these prices were a **fucking steal** - I had the balls to put only one buy in, Cardano at $0.035 and $0.038 - last week, these appreciated 31x and 27x respectively.  

And that was basically the bottom. All has risen from there.  

I made some massive, massive mistakes. I held certain shitcoins way too long, and sold ETHLEND when I broke even on it, because I didn't do any research and didn't get why it was climbing so quickly, which ultimately cost me about $4,500 in wasted gains.

I think the best thing I did was consolidate my entire portfolio. All the shit from Coinbase Earn, I just moved it all into Stellar. All the other crap, I just tied it into the good projects and Bitcoin.  

So does this current dip feel like that bear market? No. It just feels like a correction on the way to something bigger. But I do think we will see, until June, some sideways and mostly negative price action broken up with a few days of gains at a time.  

Some cardinal rules for Crypto:  

* This market is fucking irrational. It doesn't make sense that EOS enjoyed periods of insane growth after the network was basically so congested it was not functional, or after people found out that 98% of the transactions on the network was just blocks filling up with weather data from around the world...  
* Do not ever, **ever** leverage yourself to buy Crypto. I'm talking loans, credit card debt, spending money reserved for rent or mortgage. This market can and will change in the blink of an eye and it's not worth the risk.  
* **Time in the market** is truly better than **timing the market**. I tried trading a handful of times and it was a fantastic way of basically just setting fire to my money. I think my most successful trade I earned about 20 ""free"" ADA. The worst trade I did, I lost about £50 before I figured fuck it.  
* Do some fucking research! I mentioned earlier, I sold ETHLEND before it transformed into AAVE. I sold at $0.12. At it's peak, it was worth about $5.40. It annoys me nearly every fucking day.  
* We are early. Yeah, we really are. Someone on here mentioned that most people can't even tell you what Bitcoin is or does. Get in, stay in. Ride until you can take out your principal and the rest is free money.  
* Don't take it so seriously. This shit definitely affected my day-to-day. You need to learn to let it go and roll with the punches. I put in a marginal amount maybe once a month and it still felt horrible the first few times I saw deep red in the portfolio.

You're not going to retire tommorow, you should see crypto as a long term investment, like any other investment... Don't try to become a millionaire overnight...

"A beginner's guide to limit orders, stop orders, and stop limit orders",3712,lolbo6,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lolbo6/a_beginners_guide_to_limit_orders_stop_orders_and/,pseudoHappyHippy,1613869186.0,False,EDUCATIONAL,t3_lolbo6,False,219,False,0.99,"Someone in the daily said they couldn't wrap their mind around stop limit orders, so I replied to them with what ended up being a rather massive explanation for the 3 types of orders in the post title. I think a lot of beginners (both in the stock market and crypto) struggle with these concepts, so I thought I would post the entire explanation as a guide. So, here it is!

Ok, so there are **limit orders**, **stop orders**, and **stop-limit orders**. The third one combines the concepts of the first two.

Let's start with a sell **limit order.** Perhaps you hold a bunch of some asset currently at $1. You decide that if it hits $1.50, you want to sell. So you make a limit sell order. This is simply an order that will be automatically triggered at the first opportunity to sell at or above the limit price you chose, $1.50. It will only fill if you can get a price equal to or better than the limit price. You're basically publishing an offer to the world, saying ""if ever anyone wants to buy at $1.50 or higher, I am down, and my computer will automatically do the trade with you"".

But imagine you also want to automatically sell if it gets to $0.50 or lower, because you believe that would indicate free fall and you'd want to just cut your losses. A sell limit order wouldn't work here, because a limit order is triggered so long as it can be filled at the limit price or better. So, if you set a sell limit for $0.50 while the price is currently $1.00, it would be instantly triggered and your position would be sold at $1.00, because $1.00 satisfies the condition of being equal to or better than the $0.50 limit price. So, this doesn't do what you want. That's were stop orders (aka stop-losses) come in. A **stop order** will trigger a sell at the best available market price once the stop price has been reached. So, if you set the stop price to $0.50, then once the market price passes below that threshold, your position will be sold at the best available market price in that moment (which will usually be very very close to the stop price you set).

So, here is the difference between a limit order and a stop order: in a limit order, the limit price is just a threshold above which you will accept a trade and below which you will not. It's basically like an open offer to sell at some price. With a stop order, the stop price is not a threshold below which you will accept a trade. Instead, it is a trigger: once the market price passes your stop price, then your position will be sold instantly to the highest bidder in that moment.

Now, this means that usually your position will be sold basically right at the stop price (or very close, like $0.4998), because if your position is being sold to the highest bidder the moment the price touches your stop price, the highest bidder will basically be buying at the stop price. However, there are exceptions.

For example, in the stock market, there is after-hours trading when you can't trade, but special people can. Now, imagine the day closes with the price at $0.55, and your stop price is $0.50. During after hours, a bunch of whales dump the stock, and by open tomorrow morning, it is at $0.20. Your stop loss will be instantly triggered and you will sell at $0.20, not $0.50 like you wanted. This is because the triggering event of the market price passing your stop price happened (during after hours), so the position was sold at the earliest possible time at the highest available price, which happened to be at market open the next day at $0.20.

Another example is this: imagine a gigantic whale decides to sell an absurd amount of your crypto just a tiny bit above your stop loss price, at like $0.501. This triggers a massive selloff and the price drops off a cliff. It therefore drops past your stop price, so automatically you get in line to sell at the highest available price. But the demand to buy at $0.50 has already come and gone, and there aren't enough buyers to keep up with the sellers, so by the time your transaction actually gets filled, it ends up being at $0.45, not $0.50. This is called price slippage, by the way.

A third example: imagine your exchange goes down for 10 minutes when the price is at $0.52, but once it comes back 10 minutes later, the price is at $0.25, since other exchanges were running during those 10 minutes. Now your stop order will be filled at $0.25. Not ideal.

This finally brings us to the **stop limit.** The stop limit combines both limit orders and stop losses. They require that you specify two prices: the stop price, and the limit price. If the market price passes the stop price, that triggers the creation of a limit order with the limit price you specified. Let's consider a couple cases where you might want to use this.

Let's say, like before, you believe if the price gets as low as $0.50, then that signals that you need to exit. However, you are definitely not willing to sell below $0.30. You would rather just hold and hope it recovers one day than sell that low. So, you make a stop limit order where the stop price is $0.50 and the limit price is $0.30. The moment the price gets as low as $0.50, the stop will be triggered, which will then create a limit order whose limit price is $0.30. So, the stop price is the trigger to decide you want to make a sell offer, and the limit price is the lowest you are willing to sell for once the stop trigger actually happens. 99% of the time, this stop limit order will mean you end up selling basically right at $0.50, just like the stop order we talked about earlier. Once the stop price is passed, your limit order will be created for $0.30, which will immediately be filled at like $0.499, because that is the current price, and it satisfies the condition of the limit order, which is to sell at or above the limit price of $0.30. However, in the off-chance that your stop price is triggered at $0.50, but the price then somehow teleports down to $0.25 (after hours trading, price slippage, or your exchange going down) then your position would not be sold, because the price is below the limit price you set. If the price eventually recovered to $0.30, your position would then be sold at that price, if you hadn't cancelled it by then.

Another use case would be this. Say, once again, you believe that if the price drops below $0.50, that is a red flag that you should exit your position. However, you believe that if it does get that low, there is a very good chance that there will be a dead cat bounce (where something makes a short-lived partial recovery while it is in its death throes). You bet that, if this coin gets as low as $0.50, it will briefly make it back up to $0.70 before crashing fully and dying. So, you make a stop limit order with $0.50 stop price, and a $0.70 limit price. If ever the price gets as low as $0.50, you will now automatically publish an offer to sell at $0.70 (ie: a limit order with $0.70 limit price will be created). If the price now rebounds up to $0.70 like you thought it would, your order will be filled and you will sell at $0.70. If it doesn't end up rebounding that high, your order won't be filled, and you'll end up holding. It's like saying ""I believe if we go as low as $0.50, that's a good indication we are crashing hard, so I will try to exit at $0.70 shortly thereafter during a bounce, but if I can't get that good of a deal, I guess I'll just hold and hold and hope it recovers one day"".

So, in summary: A **limit order** is an open offer to sell at a certain price or better that you publish to the market. A **stop order** is a trigger threshold, which, if passed, means your position will be sold ASAP at current market price. A **stop limit order** is a trigger threshold, which, if passed, creates a limit order.

Finally, I want to note that all these examples have to do with selling, but these types of orders exist for buying as well. It works the same way, but everything is flipped. For example, if you want to buy a coin, but only if it dips below $0.25 so that it's affordable to you, then you would make a limit buy order with $0.25 as the limit price, and you would automatically buy that position if ever someone is willing to sell at that price (ie: the market price dips that low). 

I hope this helps somebody!"

Tips for Young/New Crypto Investors from a Real Grandma into Cryptocurrency...,3608,nfq1jd,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nfq1jd/tips_for_youngnew_crypto_investors_from_a_real/,Content_Structure118,1621381653.0,False,FINANCE,t3_nfq1jd,False,588,False,0.93,"Yep, I get it. Boomers aren't cool.  We are old, seemingly grumpy, not risk takers, and old school. But please, give me a minute to make you think. We were once college students or just young folks struggling to make it just like you.   

Here are some thoughts:   

1. Keep your day job. (Or get a day job!) Mine fiat by hard work every day to invest in cryptocurrency if that's your goal. Work hard and efficiently.   

You'll be happier working - I don't care how many people want to stay home and do nothing. You'll get bored. Or depressed. Or start drinking. I promise, it's not all roses having no purpose in life. 
As u/antonito901 wrote in a good article on this sub, Crypto = Great. Crypto + a Job = Wonderful!   

2. Even if you get your moon, stay in school or build your dream.  Start a business, do what you love - not what you're told to love;  go to trade school or college, even the school of hard knocks. Just get educated, wherever, however, you can. Money is not the goal...a better life is.   

3. Your 20's, 30's and 40s may take you far from family and loved ones, but work hard to keep connected with them as they will become even more important to you with each passing decade. (Not crypto advice but living advice!)   

4. Investing is risky. Don't invest what you don't have. Pay off debt (I learned this the hard way) and your life will be so much more worry free and happier. Buy necessities such as a simple car or house before that Lambo. Only risk what you can afford to lose. Don't dabble in meme coins unless you have lots of extra money you can afford to throw around.   

5.  Getting Rich Quick is usually a scam. If it were easy,  why doesn't everyone do it? Stay away from poo coins. Don't get angry when older people suggest that meme coins have no long term value. Most or all will not. Even Doge's time will come, it will grow old and out of people's minds unless it quickly develops more use cases.  Stay off CryptoMoonShots.   

Finally, failure is okay, even in Crypto. Each investment will teach you a lesson. Each time you sell will give you information. You twenty and thirty somethings have a LIFE CHANGING opportunity with cryptocurrencies. Remember it might take time,  don't sell on a whim or a worry.   

Good luck, I hope you each reach your moons, no matter what it is!"

Just hold on your strategy, dont FOMO. Use this as a buying opportunity. Savest bet is to stick with your DCA.

And never invest more money than u can afford to lose. Threat your crypto as already lost money and u wont panic while it goes even more down.

I have done extensive research and spent hours studying charts and diagrams, comparing the last few months to previous Crypto cycles. The conclusion?

*The bull market has only just started.*

Reason 1:

This chart (Figure 1) indicates we still have a long way to go before we reach the peak of the bull.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1. Upwards movement of crypto over time = profits](https://preview.redd.it/rmiguhcw7bc71.png?width=220&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd1e3dc029d62543283f1ea8fecfe28e200de974)

&#x200B;

How can you argue with this clear indication of upward momentum? This is a strong market indicator that the market is healthy.

&#x200B;

Reason 2:

There are huge profits still to be made. The average investor can expect to see this (Figure 2) in their wallets by the end of the week....

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Figure 2. Money and profits are good to have](https://preview.redd.it/hs3jcjdd8bc71.png?width=293&format=png&auto=webp&s=d08f23b968967d1c12d3a7b84c2c8528bb76ad46)

&#x200B;

If you don't like money, sell now. I guarantee anyone who holds will receive MONEY if they hold for the next couple of days.

&#x200B;

Reason 3:

I personally don't want to lose any money. I would rather have profits now than wait a couple of years. Therefore, we have to be in a bull market or I will scream.

--------------------------



Hi all,

As per the title, I'm planning to learn to write code, with the intention of becoming more involved in the growing world of crypto, and more specifically DeFi. I'm taking a guess that there might be other people wanting to do the same and so thought I'd propose a kind of mutual motivation study group.

I've been aware of crypto for a few years, but other than some investments, throwing the occasional donation to Gitcoin grants and trying to share some opinions with the crypto community in various places I haven't been that involved. A situation that I'm sure I'm not alone in.

My goals are to learn to develop dApps and contribute to the infrastructure that this new ecosystem is being built on, the barrier to this goal is my negligible knowledge of programming. My background is in physics and as such I've had to learn a few tiny scraps of Python, but I've used this so infrequently that it's really just trial and error. Effectively my knowledge level is zero. What I want to be able to do eventually is understand Solidity and probably JavaScript well enough that I can have a chance at deploying smart contracts that do what I expect them to do and therefore be part of building the DeFi future. In a dream success scenario I can eventually transition to working for a DAO, being paid on the blockchain as a developer!

If that sounds similar to your position; if you're starting to feel like you want more from crypto than just speculating on the changing value of assets or moving liquidity around between pools; or even if you just want to be able to read smart contracts well enough to improve your chances of assessing possible projects to invest in, then please comment below.


A lot of the inspiration for doing this comes from the excellent resource list posted by u/SolorMining at: https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n5jz6w/want_to_become_a_crypto_developer_here_is_a_list/ . Much credit for his or her contributions!

From that list I've put together a rough plan for study. This is based on roughly 10h per week, which is what I have previously been able to set aside for part time, home based learning. If there's lots of interest from people with different amounts of time then we can change the timings, or have different study groups moving at different paces etc. I've also not checked all of these courses for prerequisite knowledge or overlap, so there might be a much more logical order! Please let me know if this is the case! Anyway, here's a draft timeline:

But fuck him and his manipulation. 

He has brought a level of toxicity to the crypto space that should be shunned rather than welcomed. Whether it is shilling noobs into a massively over inflated meme coin that has no long term prospects due to an infinite marker cap or announcing that his company has bought thousands of bitcoins AFTER buying them to pump the price further for his own gain. His actions are both irresponsible and dare I say it outright illegal.

On top of this he is now taking advantage of NFTs with some idiot offering $1mill+ for a tweet.

If Elon wants to invest in bitcoin thats great but the way he acts and manipulates the market is no better than those shitty pump and dump telegram channels.

Edit - the downvoters are easily startled, but they will soon be back. And in greater numbers

Some also around 40%.

Keep in mind that Bitcoin had only gone 3x the previous bull market's ATH ($19,500) so far in this bull run. At the end of 2017 it had already done 15x. So it's hard to imagine that this bull run would end this soon.

In the last bull run, Bitcoin had gone 3x in the summer of 2017, then had a big crash in July.

A scenario that looks familiar to what we're in right now:

Put these two events together, and you see a lot of the same patterns:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/9henoyg3v2071.jpg?width=1342&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=61959c93fea93a4fbc5df7fde985d4519287e248

We seem to be repeating more and more of the same patterns from 2017. History is starting to really repeat itself.

Which would seem odd since we now have big institutional players, on top of everyone now knowing what happened in 2017. But that hasn't stopped people from repeating all the same mistakes. The same FOMO buying when the price goes parabolic, and panic selling at the first dip. Same volatility. Even falling for all the same scams all over again.

New players may have bigger pockets, but human psychology and behavior remains the same.

If you look at the bigger picture, it not only looks like we are following the same trend, but the price going back down is actually putting us back on track:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/eptmkkfsv2071.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a188225bdb93f167fbda7171e7b842a617668d07

We were getting too close to the upper band, and there may have been the beginning of a deviation forming. The crash has dramatically corrected that, and actually put us back more into the usual pattern, and kept us from reaching the peak too prematurely and at a lower price.

Whether this crash was caused by a Wyckoff formation or pure manipulation is another story. But whatever happened seems to be the same behavior we've seen in the last bull run."

# 

**Frequently** asked questions

1. **Wait, Kraken is becoming a bitcoin bank?**  
Kraken has always been on the frontier of finance. Now we’re blazing a new trail by opening a Wyoming-based crypto bank.  
We were calling it Kraken Financial, but due to overwhelming demand, it will be known as Kraken Bank. We’re the first (ever) crypto company to be awarded a U.S. state banking charter. It’s known as a Special Purpose Depository Institution or SPDI. 
2. **What is an SPDI?**  
It’s a bank focused on clients’ interest in a forward-facing regulatory framework with oversight from the Wyoming Division of Banking.
3. **Can I open a bank account with Kraken? When will it launch?**  
We are planning a phased launch in 2021, we’ll roll out to existing U.S. Kraken clients first and will provide more information as it becomes available.  
In the meantime, you can visit [**www.kraken.com/sign-up**](https://www.kraken.com/sign-up) to create your Kraken trading account if you don’t have one.
4. **What products will the crypto bank offer?**  
Our bank charter allows us to launch digital-first traditional and crypto banking products, with cryptocurrencies represented as a first-class citizen. We're looking into products like deposit accounts in USD and crypto assets (ex. Bitcoin), multiple funding and payments options, institutional custody products (qualified custody for advisors and broker dealers), IRAs and many more.
5. **Where will this be available and could I visit a branch?**  
We will initially focus in the U.S. roll out services to existing clients in the U.S., with potential international expansion in the future.  
Our plan is to serve our existing clients’ needs online and via mobile devices - we don’t anticipate servicing any in-person, customer-serving activities in our Cheyenne office. Customer support and service will be available 24/7/365.
6. **Will my investments be FDIC insured?**  
No. However, Kraken Bank will be fully reserved (i.e., no fractional reserve banking or associated re-hypothecation and lending activities). All assets will be kept on hand and available as cash or the least risky, most liquid cash equivalents. We will also maintain significant capital reserves and surpluses of our own capital to cover the full balance of all clients, even in the event of a “bank run.”  
We will operate in a safe and sound manner that prioritizes customer fund protection. Therefore, we will not have insolvency risk the FDIC is intended to safeguard. We will never need a bailout or any public-funded backstop, because our goal is to serve your needs and the needs of the community.

Its taken a long time but finally gone down below that.

You've probably heard many people tell you it would eventually happen back in December 2017 and to reduce expose to crypto [(including me)](https://old.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/7l7k9i/daily_general_discussion_december_21_2017/drl2esi/), but when you're hyped up on 20% gains every week its hard to be cautious or engage in defensive measures. To many the last quarter of 2017 and into early 2018 was like a beach party with coke and Victoria Secret models. Who wants to listen to someone tell you about how you're gonna crash hard with a headache the next morning?

With this latest crash, Bitcoin's price is back to roughly mid October 2017, which is roughly when the mainstream mania started. Many on this sub entered after October 2017 and hence are now left holding heavy bags. Many are down 80% or even 90%.  Here is the current losses from ATH for the top cryptos:

Asset | Loss from ATH
-- | --
BTC | -77%
XRP | - 88%
ETH | -90%
BCH | -95%
XLM | -79%
EOS | -83%
LTC | -91%
ADA | -96%
XMR | -85%
TRN | -96%

**Who do we blame?**
--------------------------------------------------

At a time like this its easy to get angry, to look at someone to blame. Whether Roger Ver and the hash wars, whether BAAKT delay, whether whales or SEC or institutions, everyone has their favorite boogeyman. No one thing is the reason why the market is down 80%. 

The reality is that Bitcoin (and all other crypto by extension) was ovevalued even by grossly overoptimistic measures. Its not BAKKT or the whales trying to get your coins for cheap. The same people who were buying at near peak bubble thinking they were getting into the chance of a lifetime are prone to look for someone to blame for their losses, when it was actually their fault for buying near the end of a mania. 

Nobody wants to admit that it was their own greed, lack of research and irrational behavior that lead to the gross overvaluation of all cryptocurrency.

**Is it over yet?**
--------------------------------------------------

The $6K consolidation was likely a result of the market coiling tighter and tighter around the mining breakeven point for some of the smaller miners. The big firms in China are profitable mining below 6K, but many smaller ones in the US and Europe aren't. You can actually [see the total hash rate going down](https://www.blockchain.com/en/charts/hash-rate). Once it broke it was a big fall straight down. 

Bitcoin is mined at 12.5 BTC. per block at 10 minute blocks, which comes out to around 1800 BTC every day. This 1800 BTC has to be absorbed by every day, which means the following at different price levels:

Price Level | Daily net buying needed to absorb mined coins
---|---
6000 | $10.8 million/day
4500 | $8.1 million/day
3000 | $5.4 million/day

At the current price, at least theoretically $8.4 million in demand is needed to cover the mining output. Of course the miners don't immediately dump it all, but it shows why miners have an incentive to keep the price high and try to incite FOMO with a BGD. 

I can also see that after this latest drop, the ""buy the dip"" sentiment had substantially gone down, at least compared to the other fast drops in price. This is especially discouraging those who were waiting for the ""November bull run"", which never came. Its clear to more people now that this probably isn't just downward correction that will reverse, but a multiyear bear market. This is why the bounce has been so weak compared to earlier in the year. Compare that to the last two big 2 day drops:

* March 29 - April 1st (drop from 8K to 6K): Within 2 days it bounced back up to 7.5K

* June 22-24 (drop from 6.8K to 5.8K): Within 2 days it bounced back to 6.3K

The weakness of this current bounce says it all, people are no longer optimistic that BAKKT or ETF or any other catalyst will lead to a bull run that they can cash out quick. It may be a period of stagnation followed by further drops as big holders take profits.

I also think that the FED tightening with rate hikes is leading to a lot more volatility not only in stocks, but crypto as well. Right now asset deflation seems to be a global macro risk as cheap credit dries up, and Bitcoin surely isn't immune from this.

My personal view is that at this point we may see further declines, but calling what's going to happen next is always dangerous. A whale (especially a big mining operation) with a series of large orders to clear out the order book on Bitfinex could give us a BGD out of nowhere at any time and take us back to 6K, it would be interesting to see how the market reacts to something like that. But I'm not betting on it leading to any sustained rally past 10K. Quite the opposite.

---------------------------------------------------

So what's a crypto shrimp to do? I'll split my thoughts into two, for those who are still in the green and those in the loss.

**If you're still in the green**
--------------------------------------------------


If you're still in profit, this is a great time to consider how much more downward selling you can take and also how you can hedge downward risk.

If you're someone who purchased when Bitcoin was below $1000, you should [calculate your compounded annual ROI](https://financial-calculators.com/roi-calculator) and decide if that return is good enough for you. For equities, the long term average is about 10% per year, 20-30% in a good bull market. 

Its your decision, but taking out profits that exceed principal and reinvesting the principal is not at all a bad idea. For those who invested before Bitcoin reached $1K (April 2017) the current price is still an insane return that no other asset class can match.

Another important thing is to think about how you can hedge the risk of downward movement. This is where derivative exchanges are very useful, although you do need to do some research on how derivatives work and how to not get liquidated. If you have substantial holdings, the effort to learn this is worth it. 

The basic idea is that you can buy short contracts that increase in value as Bitcoin goes down, proportional to the amount of leverage you put to finance the contract. If managed correctly, you can protect your entire stack with a portion as leverage. Its something commonly done by miners, who short Bitcoin with derivatives to hedge their holdings.

**If you're in the loss**
--------------------------------------------------


The untold reality is that HODL is a meme told to newbies to prevent panic selling during a downturn while the smart money cashes out in a more orderly fashion. But does that mean you shouldn't hold if you're already down massively? 

Well that depends on your own life situation, how much you've invested, and if you don't need the money for the next few years.

Mathematically, whether it drops to 4.5K or 3K from the reference of 6K is highly meaningful, its a drop of 25% or 50%. But if your reference starting point is much higher, then it really doesn't matter all that much. A drop from 17K to 4.5K is a 74% loss while down to 3K it would be 82%, massive losses either way. In that sense if this is money you don't need, it makes sense to simply have it stored in a wallet and forget about it for a few years. Who cares if it drops further after a certain point if you don't plan to take it out for a while? Its like in equities markets where people with massive losses don't sell, but instead move the loss position into their retirement fund where they don't plan to take it out for a long time and thus are giving it time to rebound back.

But what if its money you need? What if like many out there you took out loans hoping to catch a run to 50K? If you have high interest debt (credit cards...etc), focus on paying that down first. Credit cards generally have high interest and many compound daily, so pay down the debt first rather than trying to pay your debts off with a crypto bull run that may take years to materialize.

This is also a good learning opportunity. It is worrying how few people who hold crypto have a clue what any of this even is or how it works. [I've always recommended this video to explain how Bitcoin (and other cryptocurrencies) actually work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bBC-nXj3Ng4).

A good thing to do during catastrophic losses is to honestly access why you got suckered into buying high in the first place. Most people here are young, and this is a valuable lesson in why you shouldn't follow the herd.  Everyone is a genius in a bull market, everyone is chasing the next hype. Crypto tends to attract people looking for a get-rich-quick-without-effort crowd, but it takes some mental effort to understand this beyond the buzzwords. Take the time to understand the fundamental reasons why an asset has value and what factors would drive its rise once the hype dies down. What makes Bitcoin valuable, what makes some of the other cryptoassets valuable? If those fundamentals in some way changes, so should your opinion. 

Its also a great opportunity to help in its adoption by using it. The irony of it all is that people demand that they get rich because of the hard work of buying a bunch of crypto in an exchange and transferring it to their wallet, without any understanding what they're buying into. 

Also don't be angry. Don't look to blame. Look to learn and improve next time you invest.

Means a lot to me :)

&#x200B;

Hi everyone, MrNuttyJoe back again with another top-quality post. As many of you may know, Family Guy referenced Bitcoin back in early-2016. This report will analyse how Peter and the Griffin Family could have become rich through the purchase and Hodling of Bitcoin had they invested at that point in time.

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 1: Overview \*\*\***

Family Guy - Season 14, Episode 11: *The Peanut Butter Kid*

Original Airdate: January 10, 2016 (Rotten Tomatoes 2021)

&#x200B;

The Griffin family is struggling financially, and understands that some tight budgeting decisions need to be made. At exactly 01:17 into the episode, Peter announces his brilliant plan to help pull the Griffins out of the hell that is a low-middle income wage.

The transcript is as follows….

&#x200B;

*Lois Griffin:*  `Peter, every month our savings get smaller and smaller. We really gotta (sic) figure out a better way to budget for this family’s future!`

*Peter Griffin:*  `…Bitcoin!`

*Lois Griffin:*  `What?`

*Peter Griffin:*  `I don’t know.`

&#x200B;

[Image 1: A shot of the now-famous scene. Please note Peter's hesitation and pure nervousness.... now THIS is what acting is all about. Powerful!](https://preview.redd.it/6j3ggqouppe71.png?width=289&format=png&auto=webp&s=6612ce990bd9b1e81d20db86f9c02b70e6c456d4)

&#x200B;

As you can see, the idea to invest in Bitcoin is very quickly dismissed. But what if the Griffins *had* decided to make that bold leap into the world of CryptoCurrency?

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 2: Market Snapshot (as of January 10, 2016) \*\*\***

Figure 1 presents an idea of where Bitcoin was in terms of value (in USD) at the start of 2016.

&#x200B;

[Figure 1. From an ATH of $1 150 \(approx\) in 2014, BTC was hovering around $450 at the time the Family Guy episode aired in early 2016.](https://preview.redd.it/5c6wo63zrpe71.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=6c7f60593eebedf0cae71d771554fa7c73fde43a)

&#x200B;

As you can see, Bitcoin was priced at approximately $450 USD as of January 10, 2016! This is the price at which Peter Griffin would theoretically have bought in.

Comparing this to Bitcoin’s All Time High achieved in April 2021 (Figure 2):

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

[Figure 2. BTC price from the original airdate to April's ATH.](https://preview.redd.it/v9dczap3tpe71.png?width=1224&format=png&auto=webp&s=bdff6ee7eae4235d0f1e41a783c3265cb86b2e04)

A price increase from $450 to $64 800 = a ROI (Return on Investment) of approximately *14 300 %.*

The following image indicates the writer’s reaction to such an ROI:

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 3: How much could the Griffins’ Realistically Invest? \*\*\***

Calculating the size of the investment Peter and co. could put into Bitcoin will prove challenging, given we must make assumptions into the family’s finances. We will apply the following rules:

1. Only *discretionary income purchases* can be considered. We will reallocate all expenses from non-necessities purchased by the Griffins in Episodes 11-13 (around 1 month’s worth) and put them into Bitcoin; this will *not* include bills, transportation costs, etc., as these costs should ALWAYS come before investing (looking at you FOMOers).
2. No hand-outs. As you other die-hard Family Guy fans will know, certain secondary characters such as Lois’ parents and Quagmire are reasonably-well off (or just stinking rich). We will assume that Peter does *not* ask anyone for financial help to buy Bitcoin, rather relying on his own discretionary income.

Below are the following discretionary income purchases made by the Griffins within one month of Season 14, Episode 11:

&#x200B;

*Episode 11:*

· 1 Cheap Metal Detector (approximate price): $200

· Royalty Check – Stewie’s Commercial: $2 000

· A tiny, tiny amount of cocaine: $300 for a gram

· Voice-activated 3D printer: Ignored, as this was purchased using Stewie’s Royalty Check (counting this would include the Check twice)

&#x200B;

*Episode 12:*

· MLB (Baseball) Ticket + Hot Dog/Beer/Peanuts: $80 approximately

· 8-10 Build-A-Bears: $150 approximately

· 2 x Movie Tickets (based on the average ticket price in U.S., 2016 (Stoll 2021) ): $18 (rounded up)

· Purple High-Tops: $180 approximately

&#x200B;

*Episode 13:*

· Quahog Racket Club Membership (Upscale club in Rhode Island, month-long): $1 500

· Bear-BnB (Bear-themed Air-BnB; 2 nights): $400

· Flights/Vacation in Hawaii (two adults, cheap accommodation): $5 200 (BudgetYourTrip 2021)

· Chemical Castration Cost (1 month’s cost): $1 000 (North 2019)

&#x200B;

# Total Discretionary Income: $11 028.

This is the amount available for Peter Griffin to invest into Bitcoin.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\*\*\* **Part 4: Conclusion \*\*\***

At a price of $450 per Bitcoin, an investment of $11 028 would give the Griffins 24.5 Bitcoins (rounded down in consideration of fees).

At Bitcoin’s ATH price on April 14, 2021, this investment would be worth……

# $1.589 MILLION!

# 

Peter Griffin and family would have become Crypto Millionaires had Peter made the decision to invest back on that fateful day in early January of 2016.

Thank you for reading my post. As I always say….

That has been corrected.** Thanks, /u/TRossW18. Good catch! That changed things significantly. In thanks, $10 is going to the charity of your choice.

[That post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oq1p0b/coinmarketcap_on_july_23_2017_if_youve_never/) got me to thinking just how many coins completely tanked, so I decided to jump in headfirst and do some research. I apologize in advance for my formatting; I haven't actually tried to type out a legitimately formatted post on reddit in a long time.

First, I am going to show a table of all 100 coins, broken down into sections. The first section will be the Top 10 coins from 4 years ago. Included will be their ticker (their new ticker will be in parentheses, if applicable); the price on July 23, 2017; the current price (the date they ceased to exist in parentheses, if applicable); the percent increase/decrease over the past 4 years; and the ATH price (and date); the percent increase from the snapshot date to ATH (if the ATH was prior to July 23, 2017, it will show a decrease). I will talk about each section a bit before moving on to the next section and, after all the coins are posted, I'll provide some overview and some interesting tidbits.

Note: The Current Price is as of sometime yesterday, as I did my initial research throughout the day. Also, dates are in MMDDYY format. *=Current Top 100, as of the time of my research. Some coins are borderline and may have moved into or out of the current 100 as of this posting.

Below is a table with some stats from the Top 10 from 4 years ago (for monetary stats, I assume a $100 investment across the board, for a total of $10,000 invested). The stats included are: Total Profit (including initial investment); Profit per coin (in this case, the Total Profit/10); how many total coins turned a profit; how many coins went to zero; How many coins went at least 2x; how many coins went at least 4x; how many coins are still in the Top 100 today; which coin had the largest percent increase.

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$3851.27|$385.12|7|0|7|3|9|BTC

Out of this group, obviously BTC performed the best, although ETH is right on its heels. Most of the coins here have had solid run-ups overall. Half of them had their ATH reached in 2021 and, assuming the upward trend eventually picks back up and new ATHs are reached, they will likely have a different ATH in the future. 

XRP especially went bananas in early 2018 and, even though it ~~is~~ was centralized, it was one of /r/cryptocurrency's most shilled coins during that holiday period. Out of these 10 coins, only STRAT is unlikely to ever reach it's July 23, 2017 price point in the future. 

The next grouping will be coins 11-25 from 4 years ago. They had robust market caps, especially for the time, all ranging between $250M-$450M. It is really interesting to see the wild swings in this group, as this is where the gambles really start to take place. It is also where we see our first Zero Coin (coin that drops to nothing). I'm sure some of y'all might be able to guess what it is.

:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$1466.44|$97.76|5|2, almost 3|2|0|6|WAVES

Looking at the coins in this group, I was expecting NEO to have the most profit over time. Seeing WAVES slightly higher was surprising. What wasn't surprising was seeing Bitconnect (BCC) be the first Zero Coin Casualty. As an aside, if you had bought BCC on 07/23/17 and sold the day after Carlos Matos yelled his WASO WASO WASO WASO BITCONNNNNEEEEECCCCCTTTT!!!!! meme, you would have gotten out shortly before it reached an ATH and would have gotten about 5.5x return on your investment. That meme was the moment everyone with a brain realized that BCC was a complete scam and the writing was on the wall for a huge dump forthcoming. 

This group did pretty well, even with the BCC, ICN and BCN duds, but this is where the huge swings can be seen for the first time, with the exception of Tether, the one and only stablecoin in the Top 100 from 4 years ago. An abnormality in this group is EOS with its ATH date of April 2018, a good 3 months after the crash started. Intriguing. Next up are the remainder of the Top 50 from 4 years ago, including the biggest gainer of all (I'm sure you all know what it is already).

Here are the totals for this group of 25:

Total Profit|$/Coin|# Profitable Coins|Zero|2x+|4x+|Current Top 100|Biggest Increase
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$13,498.67|$498.17|10|2|5|4|5|DOGE (obviously)

One of the most eye-opening stats here is that there were only 2 Zero Coins in the entire group. That equals the number of Zero Coins from the 11-25 group, with 10 extra coins in this grouping. If you were to pick a coin at random from this group on this date in 2017, you would have a 92% chance of choosing a coin that still exists today. That's pretty impressive. 

Two obvious PNDs exist in this group (PAY and BNT), who both had their ATH prior to the date and both were over 90% off their ATH, reached within 4 weeks of the listing. BNT dropped from its ATH of 23.73 down to 2.15 in a matter of 6 days, while PAY dropped from 86.26 to 1.05 in 24 HOURS. That crash is almost as impressive as TITAN's. 

DOGE obviously carried this group with its 9540% increase. Hypothetically, if you were to invest $100 in each of the 100 coins in this list and all of them crashed to 0 except DOGE, which maintained its trajectory, you would have only lost $460 total out of your $10,000. If you were to cash out DOGE at its ATH, that $100 investment alone would have netted you $36,880. XLM also had much, much better gains than I initially calculated. Very impressive, as well.

Also, I was confused by DGD because it increased by 6.8x but is still only 481st in market cap today. DigixDAO is a unique crypto that is directly tied to gold whereby 1 DGD=1 gram of gold. Supposedly. I'd be interested to hear more about it in the comments if any of you have any working knowledge on how it works, since the price swings look similar to most other crypto. 

The next group is the remaining 50 coins. The real gambles. 38 of the remaining 50 at the time had a market cap of <$50M, with one of them being in the Top 50 for only one day, which happened to be the day of the snapshot. Here are the next 50:

Here are the totals for the bottom 50:

Total Profit|$/Coin|# Profitable Coins|Zero|2x+|4x+|Current Top 100|Biggest Increase
:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|:--|
$3779.42|$75.59|13|6, with 5 others >98% loss|5|3|0|XVG

I found it a bit odd that none of the Top 100 from 4 years ago are currently in the Top 100 now (even though a few are close). There also wasn't nearly as much capitulation as I thought there would be. There are 5 Zero Coins in this group, which is more than the other groups combined (comparing Top 50 to Bottom 50, it was actually close, though). There are a lot of coins with 75% losses, and many that are on the verge of dying completely.

The most fascinating coin to me in this group, and maybe out of the entire research, is COE. It just so happened that this coin debuted on 07/23/17 and was actually off its ATH (or hadn't reached it yet) at the time the Wayback Machine performed its timestamp. That coin hit 1400 during the same day, a few days later was trading under 50 and within 3 months was completely dead. There were other obvious PND's to stay away from in this group. DCT dropped from 19.19 to 3.02 over 4 days just a month prior. MCO had its ICO date 6 weeks prior and was already 77.78% in the red. 

OMNI, while not an obvious PND, was way off it's ATH, which was in late 2013 at 1150. By July 2017, it was trading at 42.99. Now, it's at $4.20. That reminds me of a current coin that is in the Top 25 right now that had a much higher valuation than it currently does *cough cough ICP cough*. It'll be interesting to see where that coin stands in 4 years, if it does at all.

Over 60% of coins in this list had their ATH occur between December 2017 and January 2018. EOS is an anomaly in the fact that it is the only coin to have its ATH in 2018 but not in January. There are 18 coins who had their ATH in 2021 and, assuming the crypto market recovers to reach new ATH's, they are poised to potentially also have new ATH's in the future. The 18 coins are:

BTC, ETH, LTC, ETC, XMR, WAVES, DOGE, MAID, DGB, DCR, BAT, DGD, DAWN, ANT, LEO, NMR, RLC and STORJ. 

Finally, out of the 100 coins:

35% turned a profit over 4 years.

12% lost between 75-90% in value. 23% lost between 90-99.98% in value. 10% became casualties and are Zero Coins.

If you threw a dart at the board, you'd have roughly a 1 in 3 shot of making a profit and a 1 in 5 shot of doubling your money.

The chances were greater if you saw obvious PND's and either avoided them or invested but got out in time. The easiest one to predict was BCC. Personally, I was invested in BCC and got out within 15 minutes of seeing their promo video in Singapore, headlined by Carlos Matos. That shit was laughable and it was time to nope the fuck out of there. 

I hope you enjoyed seeing some of these numbers. Personally, it was fun to look into some coins that I haven't thought about in years and to research some that I'd never heard of before. It will be interesting to visit today's Top 100 in 4 years to see which ones have survived and which ones will either be struggling or will be non-existent. Questions and comments are welcome. It's late here (2:30 am), but if I don't get to your question tonight, I'll be sure to look into it tomorrow!

Edit: I forgot to post the total. $100/coin invested makes the total investment $10,000. The total today would be $22,595.80. Over 40% of that is DOGE. The Top 5 Gainers (DOGE, BTC, XLM, ETH, XVG) would account for $13,331.89 of that total, or 60%."

"The Crypto Fear and Greed index is now at 12 (extreme fear). It has only dropped to this level five times in the past this cycle. So lets look at those dates, and look at the bitcoin price at that point and see whether each time presented a good buying opportunity.",3307,niuoe2,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/niuoe2/the_crypto_fear_and_greed_index_is_now_at_12/,Cryptodragonnz,1621725393.0,False,STRATEGY,t3_niuoe2,False,793,False,0.96,"For those you aren't aware, the Crypto Fear and Greed index uses 5-6 measurements to assess the current sentiment of the market and then rates that level of emotion on a scale of 1 to 100. 1 is extreme fear and 100 is extreme greed.

Those measurements are objective of course - they look at volatility, social media, momentum, dominance, google trends and (now paused) surveys.

Here is the link to the site, you can look at the chart, click ""max"" and you will see a movement of the index since the start of 2018.

[https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/](https://alternative.me/crypto/fear-and-greed-index/)

In theory, the idea should be that in cases of extreme fear, the market is terrified and panic selling, and it is a good buying opportunity. When the market is in a state of extreme greed, people are getting extreme fomo and buying regardless of the elevated prices. Hopefully you get the picture.

There is a lot of movement in the chart but it is the extreme fear and greed regions that interest me - specifically around the region of 80 plus or 20 below.

Today the fear and greed index is at 12 - not a record low but very close and certain the lowest for a very long time. And yet the price is at $37,500 - still historically extremely high.

Looking at the index to date, there are only five other times in the past where the index has plunged below 20. I thought it would be helpful to look at that regions, what was happening and the price at that point, and to think of those as historical buying points:

**6 February 2018 - Index Score: 8. BTC Price $6,852.**

This is probably the point at which there was a realization we truly were in a bear market, with bitcoin already down around 65% since its top. While buying at this point (the start of a 1 year bear market) is not exactly enticing, that price was more or less the average price for most of the year. Certainly not a bad entry point if you had resisted the temptation to buy in the entire bull market of 2017.

**1 April 2018 - Index Score 16. BTC Price $6,975**

Around March of 2018 was a bit of a ""dead cat bounce"" with the price recovering to nearly $12,000. Many people breathed a sigh of relief, portfolios turned green and it seemed like the bear market was over. Nope. Bitcoin immediately crashed right back down again to prices similar to February. Hence a moment of extreme fear.

Again, this wasn't a particularly bad buying point historically, having just avoiding fomo of the surge in bitcoin up to that much higher price level.

**25 November 2018 - Index Score 9. BTC Price $3,895**

Now we're talking. This was the time of the infamous ""hash wars"" when BCH forked and the markets plunged into absolute chaos. Bitcoin crashed through its $6,000 support level and halved in price.

This was an absolute buying opportunity - perhaps the opportunity of a lifetime, with an average price around this level for six months. Happy to say I bought right through but not enough. Each buy at the time seemed painful, and it was embarassing at times for people to even know you were in crypto.

Also recall that at $3,100 very few people were calling this the bottom (shout out to Smart Contractor from twitter here who picked it). Many had buy ladders down to $1.3k, and it seemed a fall to at least the mid $2,000s was obvious. A little bit like those all calling for $25k right now.

**22 August 2019 - Index Score 5. BTC $10,124**

This one might feel like a bit of an anomaly, but in some ways it feels quite similar to today. Bitcoin had just ripped from $4k to around $14k and the bull run was on. After a short period, bitcoin fell sharply and the price started to collapse downwards. I think ""5"" is a bit extreme for fear but this was the realization that the bull market might be over. For the next six months, the bitcoin price let out steam down to $6.5k (aside from one day when President Xi managed to pump us back to $10,300 - oh for the days when China would actually pump our prices).

So not a great buying spot, but better than FOMOing at $14k and historically still not bad.

**13 March 2020 - Index Score 10. BTC $5,142**

I don't think this one needs much explanation. The corona effect was sharp and deadly, with the bitcoin price absolutely collapsing quickly. Again, I don't think we have any debate that this was one hell of a buying opportunity. Even more if you had cash to deploy in the weekend. One person I know bought ETH at $85 or so at that point. And there are some people suggesting the charts today are quite similar to this. Hmmmm.

**Today. Index Score 12. BTC $37,753**

What can we say? I think the terror here is real. But at the same time a billion dollars of stable coins just flooded into binance and bifinex, and funding rates have switched negative. If we look to the panic in November 2018, this was the start of a six month period of hell - worst case scenario we might get something like that, but also recall that in November the worst was already nearly over.

To be continued!

EDIT:  For those wondering what I am doing right now, not much.  My yield farms are running at full capacity - I'm still harvesting them and sending all the crypto to binance to buy BTC.

Once you accept that we all are diving into the unknown, in a completely unpredictable market where a moon or a crash might happen the very next second, you are able to make better choices. You set yourself free.

No, you haven't figured it out, nor has some Youtuber. 

No, technical analysis can't predict prices and 95% of day traders get burnt. That's a fact.

Now, when big money has entered the chat and can manipulate the market at their will. We, the retail investors are left at their mercy.

Yes, it's reasonable to expect that BTC and solid alts will be worth more than today in the long and mid term, but even then, remember that dozens of solid projects have failed and never recovered. We are *speculating* on what might be and which projects will make it.

Wether we are in a bull supercycle or a bear already, is irrelevant when you keep the big picture in your mind.

You're like an astronaut, sailing to space with your portfolio as a ship, seeking for fortune. Anything might happen: your ship's hull might break and suffocate you to death in 5 seconds, or you might find your moon tomorrow.

Remember this, it will set you free. It will allow you to withdraw from emotions and simply look at your portfolio with serenity, thus making better decisions.

Stay humble y'all!

"NFT Madness - What they are and what they are not. Why they're great, and why they suck.",3238,lzjuf7,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/lzjuf7/nft_madness_what_they_are_and_what_they_are_not/,CrabCommander,1615094187.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_lzjuf7,False,788,False,0.97,"NFTs are the hottest new topic in the Crypto scene, blowing up enough to even garner a good bit of public attention outside of the usual crypto fanatic outlets.  The only problem with this is that beyond the surface level idea, *no one knows what they are or how they actually work.*

It's time to shine a little light on NFTs, and take a proper, *deep* dive into how they work, and how many people are ***getting scammed via NFTs.***


Now then.  Let's begin.

#1. What are NFTs, really?

Everyone knows the analogy of them being collectibles.  Unfortunately this analogy is woefully inadequate at best, and actively malicious at worst.

NFTs (Non Fungible Tokens) as an umbrella term just means that each digital token on the network is unique.  Each token contains some small bit of data that is unique to the token in question.  That's it.  They're just little data containers being shipped around the blockchain between addresses.

Now, NFTs on specifically Ethereum have a few data points that are unique to why anyone cares about them.  (It's also likely other networks will implement some or all of these features, if they have not already.)

1.  NFTs have their creator's address saved as part of the NFT.  Likewise, the current owner of the NFT is public information as well.

2.  A Royalty % may be set in the NFT token.  When the NFT is then traded *at any point in time, between any two addresses* for ETH/currency, the royalty cut of that 'sale' will be redirected to the *Creator*'s ETH address.

Now, before we go any further, it's important to understand one more aspect of NFTs.  ***NFTs are very, very small.***  It is exorbitantly expensive to store real data on a blockchain, even something as small as a 64x64 jpg.  Most NFTs are only going to have a few *bytes* of data stored in them.  Like, for example, a serial number or URL.

In short ***an NFT is basically a unique scrap of paper with a serial number, password, or web address on it.***  That's it.


#2.  What NFTs -are NOT-

NFTs are ***not*** digital media.  They do not store the digital media on the blockchain.  If you buy an NFT for some image or song, what you're really getting is a Token with a URL to a song or image, hosted on some random webserver.

NFTs do not prevent copying, alteration, deletion, or any other actions regarding any digital or physical thing they link to.

NFTs ***do not inherently confer ownership over any assets they link to.***

Again, before we continue, let's take a brief moment to review:  ***NFTs are just unique tradable 'scraps ' with a small amount of information scribbled on it.***

#3.  So how do these scraps of paper get value?


NFTs have a few potential ways to *actually* mean something.

**1 -  The NFT may unlock some functionality, feature, etc. when connected to some external system.**

NBA Topshot implements this, for example.  Your NBA Topshot token effectively has value via interacting with their systems to display the 'moment' it represents on their website.  It's important to understand here, that if NBA TopShot went under, the TopShot tokens would immediately become 'worthless', as you would no longer be able to access the 'NBA Moments' they represent.

The same is true, for example, for CryptoKitties.  If their site/etc. goes down, your CryptoKitty tokens are now meaningless/function-less.

In both these cases, your NFT is basically just a trade-able serial number that represents a 'Moment' or 'CryptoKitty' on their servers, and allows you to interact with said 'Moment' or 'Kitty' via their application.

Another more off the wall example in this space is you could have NFTs which may be submitted to an application that then burns(destroys) them in exchange for sending you some physical good or service, such as a t-shirt.

**2 -  The creator of some media (or physical thing) may sell legal rights to the media along with the sale of an NFT.**

Now, this one gets *problematic*, ***fast***, and is where many people are getting scammed.

1.  There is no guarantee the user you are buying the NFT from actually owns rights to the thing represented/linked to by the NFT.

2.  In order to legally transfer rights/ownership/etc. you must put it on paper paper/document it.  (And for larger items like a house or business, this requires significant legal information in the documentation).


What this means, is that if you want to buy 'ownership' of some linked asset via its NFT, you have to do your own diligence to ensure:

1.  They are the current copyright owner.

2.  They are consenting, in writing, to selling the rights to you with/via the NFT, and included whatever legal documentation is necessary, if any additional is required.

At that point you can guarantee you've at least bought ownership rights of the thing.  However, there's no reason you can't simply *sell those ownership rights independent of the NFT* in the future.

In short, there is *nothing legally tying NFTs to digital rights ownership at present*.

**3 - Unique/secret data**

In this case, an NFT would contain some variety of unique data, only visible to the address it is owned by, such as a unique URL, or password to a secret clubhouse.  If the buyer has a reasonable belief that this information is still secret, buying/trading the NFT  becomes the primary way to obtain it.  Some Rarible sales attempt to go this route, however, the issue here is obvious.  It's the internet, nothing stays secret for long, and you have no guarantee that the creator or previous owners have not shared the secret information into the wild.

#4. How you are going to get scammed.

1.  Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of a thing when the seller doesn't own the thing to start with.

2.  Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of the thing without ever actually getting it in writing/legally enforceable.

3.  Buying an NFT for 'ownership' of the thing and getting non-exclusive rights (instead of exclusive rights to the thing), meaning the author can continue to mint infinite more NFTs of exactly the same thing.

4.  Buying a 'collectible' NFT and the collectible site/host/system goes under/pulls the rug.

5.  Buying an NFT for 'investment', only for that NFT to have an exorbitant (50-100%) royalty fee.  Meaning most or all of the proceeds of your investment go to the creator, instead of you, when you re-sell the NFT.

6.  Buying NFT art/etc. and having the url host of the digital media go down, (or they maliciously change it) so your NFT no longer shows what you bought.  ( But at least you still have ownership rights if you didn't get burned on #1/#2 ... )

Okay, enough doom and gloom.

#5.  What are NFTs good for then?

The biggest *real* success story for NFTs right now are systems like TopShot, CryptoKitties, CryptoPunks, etc.  Cases where a website/app/game can interact with the NFTs directly to show you your content, as a proof of ownership of that content, enforced by the app/game.  Likewise, NFTs have big potential for game item marketplaces as the company can issue their items with some royalty rate (ex. 1%), and always get a cut of sales if their game (and trade of its items) takes off.

NFTs can also make for good 'proof of attendance'/historical proof type tokens, which is to say, you could be given one for attending a concert as proof you were there.

In the same vein, NFTs are *perfect* for digital ticket sales.  They can't directly be copied/cloned, and even if they're resold on a secondary market, you will get a cut of it.  (At least, as long as the scalpers play within the system, and don't, say, just sell the ETH address that owns the token, or take cash as payment then transfer the token for 'free'.)

As far as ownership of real unbound digital assets, or physical objects, there is certainly interesting *potential* there, but right now, they're legally useless.

It's also worth noting there's a little more nuance into interesting things NFTs can do in terms of smart-contract-esque stuff that's a little too technical for this post, but might show up in future use cases for them.

Oh, yeah, they're also great for *money laundering*, since if you're buying some nonsense collectable picture of a hat on the internet, it's impossible to say you 'overpayed', so that's a thing.

# Closing Thoughts

I think that about covers NFTs, and *hopefully* this post keeps at least one person from getting scammed.  NFTs *are* a really cool technology with a lot of potential, but when I see people asking crazy questions in the daily about them, it's become clear that they're really selling on hype and a total lack of understanding so far, sadly.

Regardless, thanks for reading, and take it easy."

I made an initial investment of $7K which turned into $120K at the height of the bull run. My initial goal was to 2x my investment. When I hit $14K greed took over and I said “alright, I’m cashing out at $50K”. But I waited. Then I hit $100K. I thought “damn good thing I didn’t cash out or I would have missed out on so much”. 

Delusion took over and my new goal was $1M.  Why not? It was *only* 10x more. Then cryptos started crashing. I held on due to greed. It’ll bounce I thought after every crash. Because I was all in on alts I soon found my $120K was $4K. Not only did I lose all that paper gains but I even lost some of my initial investment (technically didn’t lose because I didn’t sell). At this point, I decided to just hold onto to it. Well the bull run came back and my $4K was up to $60K or so. I ended up selling to pay off some student loans and CC debt. Yep, I missed out on a lot more gains if I held on this time around, and who knows what will happen. I’m sure it’ll go up for few more months… but I didn’t want to be left with nothing for a second time. At least now i can save money and DCA in for the next bull run in a few years. 

This story is not that unique, it happened to so many people. Don’t let greed stop you from taking profits. It’s not minimizing profits, it’s minimizing risk. 

There’s a lot of people who think “all or nothing” and that’s not necessarily wrong but keep your expectations straight. You’re not going to be a millionaire with a $1K investment  in one bull run, save for the extreme outliers that buy absolute shitcoins that moon. BUT you can be a millionaire within 2 maybe 3 cycles of the bull run by DCAing profits up and reinvesting profits during the bear market. 

There are people who decide they don’t want to deal with the stress and work and rather just keep their coins and not trade. That’s fine too and it will work out. But this applies only to legit projects. You can’t keep a meme coin for decades (maybe I’m wrong but it’s not an outrageous assumption). 

Anyway, I’m out of crypto because I accomplished what I needed this run - paying off debt. I’m saving straight cash now and waiting for the next bear market to DCA in. No I don’t think the bull run is over just yet - so don’t take this as fud. I’m just a random redditor who is happy for paying off soul crushing loans. 

Best of luck to you all, and see y’all again in a few years. We will all be on yachts soon."

\*\*Brave Browser\*\*

What it is: Brave is a free browser to download and use - essentially an alternative to Chrome or Firefox. And as an actual browser, I must say I’m quite pleased. It’s fast, simple, and comes with built in adblocker and Tor browser. But we aren’t here to talk about free browsers. In addition to blocking ads, Brave (if you allow it to) will send you ads of their own, and give you the revenue in crypto. Every fifteen minutes or so while browsing the net, a little popup text box appears in the bottom right of my screen, advertising a product. I close it out, and a few pennies are added to my account. Brave pays out in the form of BAT tokens. It was easy to setup - simpler if you have an uphold account - and I found the ads to be unobtrusive.

Results: I’ve had Brave for more than a year now and in that time have accumulated 58 BAT, currently worth $46 CAD. Considering that a) I like this browser more than Chrome and b) I have now completely forgotten about the ads and click them away unconsciously, I think this is great. It also helps that BAT has risen so significantly in the last year, and if its a coin you see promise in, I can’t recommend this enough.

Verdict for Brave: Excellent. Highly Recommended.

&#x200B;

\*\*Presearch\*\*

What it is: It’s a search engine. You can use it instead of google. Just like google, there are ads - sites paying to be listed first - but unlike google, they pay you a portion of the revenue. If you’ve ever used Bing’s reward program, its very similar but in crypto rather than fiat. I set it as the search engine in browser bar, and as someone who googles things regularly (me bid dumb ape) I was quickly gaining coins. As a search engine I would say it is ‘okay.’ Though it is designed so you can easily switch to looking at your results in google.

Results: You gain .12 tokens per search (up to 30 per day) and can withdraw after gaining 1,000 tokens. Obviously, how much you make will depend on how often you search things. Personally, I set this as my default search engine and forgot all about it. Do your own research, but I see no downsides.

Verdict for Presearch: Good. Recommended.

&#x200B;

\*\*Honey Miner\*\*

What it is: It’s a crypto miner that assesses your computers capabilities, and runs accordingly (or so it claims). I have a MacBook Pro, so certainly no mining rig. No GPUs, really nothing that could help me do actual crypto mining. So I set up Honeyminer, and it mines in the background with the resources that are available.

Results: My MacBook got hot and got hot fast. I left it overnight a few times, but honestly, I was concerned about the heat, so I googled it. Sure enough, this is a common issue, and from what I read online, it’s a bad idea to let it run for too long unless you have a third-party cooling unit. This meant that I was left running it for short spurts during the day, which was far less effective. If you have a gaming computer or proper cooling system, this might work well for you. Otherwise, I’m not so sure.

After a month I stopped using it for fear of damaging my computer. In the month that I did use it (as I said, on and off) I made 1200 Satoshi, currently worth about $0.40 USD. But honestly a) I didn’t run it near as much as I could and b) it runs in the background, meaning virtually no time and effort after installation. If you are able to run this without damaging your hardware, why not? As always, do your own research, but this seems okay to me.

Verdict for Honeyminer: Could be good if you have the right computer

&#x200B;

\*\*COIN geominer\*\*

What it is: A phone app that (claims to) scrape geodata and turn it into reward points that can be redeemed for crpyto. I’m essentially a blue blip on a map of my city, and as I move around, the square area I’m on is “mined” and turns blue. The more squares you mine, the more coins you get, and you can re-mine a square after a few minutes. Just think of it as a far simpler version of Pokemon go. I usually go for a walk each day, so I brought it with me and mined all the trails and parks in the area. I’d boot up the app, stick it in my hoodie pocket (can’t lock the screen) and a half hour walk would drain about half my battery. You can also fill out surveys and watch videos to earn coins, but this sort of defeats the idea of being “free,” since this actually requires time.

Results: In 3 months I have made 4,000 in-app coins. 10,000 coins can be redeemed for XYO Erc-20 tokens. 1.8 million coins can be redeemed for 0.025 Bitcoin and 5.4 million can be redeemed for one ETH. The quickest way to gain coins is not to use the geominer at all, but to fill out surveys. Back in a different lifetime I used to fill out surveys for a local company and got paid by cheque (in fiat obviously) and I’d say the prices are similar. Currently I walk with the app, let it drain my battery, check in for bonuses everyday and it will take about 9 months to earn some XYO coins which really don’t seem worth it. To earn BTC will require about ten years. I’d say stick with the surveys. The pay isn’t good, but its comparable to other places that pay you to do surveys.

Verdict for COIN: Skip the geomining feature. If you’re willing to write surveys, they will pay you in crypto.

&#x200B;

\*\*Stormgain Express\*\*

What it is: It claims to be a Bitcoin miner for your phone, but it most certainly is not. Basically every four hours you log onto the app, hit the “bitcoin miner” button and it will start spitting out some numbers that look like crypto wallet addresses. Each time you mine it will give you a little bit of money. According to the app and the website, it sincerely claims this is bitcoin mining. However, if you know anything (and I mean ANYTHING) about bitcoin mining, this has to be a straight up lie. Mining on my phone (and a crappy one at that)? It works even when I turn off my wifi and data? And my phone doesn’t even overheat? I don’t know what’s going on here, but they claim its bitcoin mining. Anyways, I tried to reactivate this every four hours. I’m going to say I ran it an average of three times a day for two months.

Stormgain express is also just a good old fashioned crypto exchange. You can put in money and trade. So bear that in mind - some people may want to use this as their primary trading app, and let the miner add a few pennies along the way. In fact, it claims it will mine faster if you deposit money. You can do this at your own risk - I never did, and can’t vouch for the security of the app. I only ever used the free miner, and added no money of my own.

Results: You can withdraw your money after you make $10 USDT, which took me about a month. Honestly, not bad for an I-don’t-know-what-you’re-actually-doing-app. Once you’ve withdrawn the money, you can turn them into put calls on a crypto of your choice. I used the app for a second month and only made $2. So I’m guessing it’s an incentive to get you in for the first month, and then productivity seemed to plummet. I should also add that there are incentives for getting your friends to download and mine with you.

Verdict for Stormgain: It’s good for the first month.

&#x200B;

\*\*Pi\*\*

What it is: An app where you log in everyday and click a button to ‘mine digital currency.’ You can do this once every 24 hours. Pi claims to be a crypto coin that will be ‘launching soon.’ In other words, I’m getting paid in a coin that hasn’t dropped yet.

Results: If Pi is a real coin that drops someday and becomes valuable, that’s great, I’ve got lots. But I’m doubtful. I’m not sure what harm there is to “mining” every day, but the whole thing feels shady. The app claims that once the coin drops you won’t be able to mine anymore so now is the time to do so. I’m not convinced Pi will ever materialize.

For now, I’ve mined every day for almost 3 months and have made 136 pi. How much is this worth you ask? Nothing. Nada. Zilch. If you believe the developers are really developing something, go for it, I guess. I see no harm in this app (do your own research) I just don’t see any benefit.

Verdict for Pi: Not worth it.

&#x200B;

\*\*Cointiply\*\*

What it is: It’s both an app and a website that offers free Bitcoin hourly. All you have to do is log in and fill out a captcha and you are rewarded. I tried to check back in hourly for a month. I’m going to say I averaged 5-6 times per day.

Results: After one month I have made 2,483 in-app coins, worth .00000762 BTC, or $0.25 USD. The minimal withdrawal amount is 50,000 coins (30,000 if you withdraw to DOGE). At this rate it will take me 20 months to make a withdrawal. In that time I will have earned approximately $5 USD, which will then be converted into whatever the price of BTC is at that time. That is, if this site actually pays out and isn’t a scam. Anyone willing to wait 20 months to find out?

Verdict for Cointiply: Not Worth it

&#x200B;

\*\*Free Cypto/Faucet Apps\*\*

What it is: There’s a bunch of these apps (I have an android but I assume iPhones are the same) that claim to offer free crypto and/or to be faucets. I downloaded several and they are all essentially the same. I ended up using one called ‘Free Litecoin’ for a month to see how it went. Every hour you can log in and hot a button that spins and decides if you won free coins or not. I played an average of 5-6 times per day for a month and would say I usually won once per day. You can watch ads to earn additional spins, which, if I’m not mistaken, increased my chances of winning. As far as I can tell, all of these apps (and there are many of them) are essentially the same. It’s a randomized game that may or may not pay out every hour.

Results: ‘Free Litecoin’ pays in Litoshi (the smallest unit of Litecoin). After one month I have made 14,855 Litoshi. You need 100,000 to withdraw. Bear in mind there are 100 million Litoshi on a litecoin. This means that at current trading value, I make approximately 29 cents Canadian each month in this app. It will take me more than 6 months to make a withdrawal, worth about $1.70 CAD. That is, assuming you actually can withdraw and this isn’t just a scam.

Verdict for Free Crypto Apps: Not Worth It

If you are in this for the long-term, don't do this to yourself. Honestly, it is okay to be interested in crypto, read about it, discuss it, etc.

But being obsessed with it, constantly checking prices, calculating future profits is not a healthy thing to do. It consumes a great proportion of your time and energy, and it's basically an emotional rollercoaster.

I have seen people being reluctant to invest now or waiting for a dip because they think cryptocurrency has grown too quickly. But if cryptocurrency lives up to its potential of becoming a foundation of the new financial system, then there is still potential for 100x growth in almost any Cryptocurrency project with good fundamentals. 

This metric is also reason why the major institutions and banks have recently started dabbling in cryptocurrency. 

So, it's never too late to get a piece of the future.

And on behalf of the seemingly few left in the world that actually cares about your past work, we sincerely apologize for the failure of Justin, Tron, and the ""new BTT team's"" utter disrespect and lack of care for the continued improvement of the BT protocol. This apology extends to the IPFS team as well. It just utterly blows my mind that a project literally forks every repo from a non-tokenized, open-source and non-profit organization, then continues to talk them down and give them shit because BTFS has ""more users.""

Since the acquisition of BitTorrent, Inc. (do not confuse this with the BitTorrent protocol):

* There have been zero protocol level improvements to BitTorrent clients nor uTorrent. I've spent countless hours reverse engineering BT/UT (BitTorrent / uTorrent) in search of  something, *anything.* But the deeper I looked, the sadder I got.
* The BT and UT clients have forcibly been closed source. Along with it, much of the original devs ongoing projects and plans were put to halt and presumably told to take down. If you look through GitHub and old forum posts, you'll see a lot of activity on BT/UT development, including user-submitted plugins and improvements. They all abruptly halted around 2018-2019, with Justin going as far as even removing some functionality that allowed for client enhancements.
* For a long time I was under the impression that the Tron/BTT team pioneered a way to allow P2P token transfers through torrent seeding, so I cut them a little slack for the lack of any activity on the BT/UT development end. Oh boy was I wrong. The BTT Speed bidding system was just BEP10 (Extension Protocol authored by Arvid Norberg of libtorrent in collaboration with UT). The BTTT team simply added a wallet on top of it, added it as a plugin on top of BT/UT, and pushed a WebUI with the most minimal, useless features that do not even record accurate data.
* BT/UT has been completely close-sourced, which I am sure they are regretting. It makes perfect sense why the BTT Speed wallet exchange has been down for 60 days now, after what was supposed to be a 2-hour maintenance. It's cause they didn't write the m'fkin protocol, and now the one or two devs working on BTT Speed are completely flabbergasted  which led to an emergency multiple job-listing posts days after they realized they were fucked.
* They forked almost every single IPFS repo's on GitHub (seriously, go check), implemented their minor changes, and now is the biggest shit talker on IPFS. You know what we called people doing shit like this back in the day? Script-kiddies.
* BTT is not some small project with big ambitions. It's a fucking billion dollar market cap project. They raised $7.1mil through the ICO. And what do they have to show for it? Zero improvements in the clients (the community literally had to modify the client to unlock the 32-bit restriction as they are still stuck in 2012 and don't have a 64-bit version -- it'd take a day or two to release a 64-bit even if through LAA flag), a marketing team that posts cool images on Behance from time to time, a 24/7 twitter meme poster, and a bunch of forked codes. Where did the $7.1mil go? Definitely not development. Maybe a fancy office in SF? Or a fancy dinner with Warren Buffet? This is almost criminal.

But with the small crypto I've bought every month, I'm already over that minimum wage. South Africa is like two countries there is such a wealth gap, and the government which was supposed to fix it hasn't. I mean imagine if Zimbabweans had been able to use crypto to protect what they had before their currency evaporated?

But my government can't stop crypto and they can't control it or mess around with it (big problems with corruption here). So I think that even if we invest at low income levels, this can be the boost we need to be able to live a decent life. At least I hope.

The basics of Nano — why it’s such an exciting crypto,3061,o1texp,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/o1texp/the_basics_of_nano_why_its_such_an_exciting_crypto/,SenatusSPQR,1623923441.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_o1texp,False,2890,False,0.67,"Edit: comments are sorted by controversial, so if you scroll to the comments you'll see a lot of toxicity (these are by definition the most up *and* downvoted comments).

*Hey all. I originally wrote this intended as an article for those new to crypto and Nano, but figured you might enjoy it here as well. Comments welcome*

First off, to understand the excitement about Nano, all you need to do is **try it out for yourself, within 2 minutes.**

1. Install [Natrium](https://natrium.io/).
2. Visit a [Nano Faucet](https://freenanofaucet.com/).
3. Fill in your Nano\_ address and hit send.

To fully appreciate Nano’s speed and ease of use, it’s recommended to get a second wallet on the side, like [www.nault.cc](http://www.nault.cc/) in your browser, or [Nalli](https://nalli.app/) as a second app on your phone. Nano tends to transfer faster than you can switch screens. Try sending some from one wallet to the other and see for yourself. Sending to yourself like this doesn’t seem impressive, but the transfer you just did is possible from and to **anyone, anywhere, anytime**, with no one able to stop your transfer and not a cent paid in fees. It’s secure, borderless and uncensorable money, open to anyone.

**A short history of cryptocurrency**

Cryptocurrency started with [Bitcoin](https://www.wired.com/2011/11/mf-bitcoin/). Created by [Satoshi Nakamoto](https://www.investopedia.com/tech/three-people-who-were-supposedly-bitcoin-founder-satoshi-nakamoto/), Bitcoin solved the challenge of how to have digital money that could not be copied. It offered a form of money that no one party could print more of, or block transfers of. In doing so it offered a way to transact, internationally, without relying on (central) banks, accessible to anyone with an internet connection.

This was an attractive proposition following 2008. At the time, many banks were being bailed out, while central banks printed a lot of extra currency to support these bailouts. [This money printing hasn’t stopped since](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-ecb-policy-idUSKBN2B22TY), leading many people to conclude that as extra dollars and euros are being printed, the dollars and euros they hold are becoming worth less and less over time.

[Bitcoin transaction cost and speed](https://preview.redd.it/2wcjjrgyrv571.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=5cd34bcf36ef4a5f681d96736effe3ad091bbbee)

However, Bitcoin comes with its own share of issues. Transfers take, on average, [over 2 hours,](https://www.blockchain.com/charts/avg-confirmation-time) while being incredibly expensive, and [Bitcoin uses more energy than some countries](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet). It doesn’t scale, with capacity maxing out at roughly 7 transactions per second, and due to the fees and waiting times is practically unusable as currency. While a beautiful idea, as a means of payment it has failed.

**Enter Nano**

Nano’s primary developer, Colin LeMahieu, was enthusiastic about the possibilities that a self-sovereign form of money like Bitcoin offered. However, he was frustrated with the inefficiencies in (then) current cryptocurrencies. In 2014, he began development on a new cryptocurrency. The goal was to create a cryptocurrency that could be used for daily payments by everyone, without the [carbon footprint that comes with Bitcoin](https://senatus.substack.com/p/swap-bitcoin-for-nano-save-the-planet).

>[Nano makes money efficient for a more equal world — simple to pay with, easy to accept and open to all.](https://nano.org/)

To accomplish this, Colin came up with a new architecture for Nano. Rather than having one big blockchain, [where everyone competes for space](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDEQE8lmaqs) in the next “block” to be mined, Nano utilises something called the [Block Lattice](https://www.mycryptopedia.com/nano-block-lattice-explained/). Instead of competing for space, users add blocks to their own chain and broadcast this addition to the network.

[Nano's block lattice graphic](https://preview.redd.it/9zzalzlzrv571.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=b253fce98704ea8ab1c0c76e8b7a9790f6df7b9f)

Nano combines the block lattice architecture with [Open Representative Voting](https://docs.nano.org/what-is-nano/overview/#representatives-and-voting) (ORV). Every Nano holder votes for a Representative using their Nano balance. Anyone can be a Representative, and anyone can change their vote at any time. These Representatives confirm transactions (67% consensus needed) as soon as they see a transaction, which means that Nano’s speed is mostly limited by internet connection latency (practically the speed of light). This is what allows the Nano network to confirm transactions within a second.

In mining, energy is expended to be the first to mine a block. In Nano, there is no such competition. Because there are no mining rewards and no fees, the network is cooperative. In mining chains, hardware resources are used for competition. In Nano, every available resource is used to confirm transactions as securely and quickly as possible. If Representatives upgrade their hardware, the throughput of the Nano network increases. This focus on pure efficiency and lack of waste makes Nano a green option that uses very little energy.

[Nano's energy usage](https://preview.redd.it/4n1250k0sv571.png?width=602&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8074a69f1d29a57e1b0acb537ad7c9a82cb9231)

Summarising, Nano uses a block lattice where each person has their own chain, rather than one big chain. Anyone can add blocks to their own chain, at any time, and Representatives (validators) confirm these transactions as soon as they see them. Because of this, Nano manages to be instant, feeless, scalable, and incredibly energy efficient.

**Spam in Nano**

Because Nano is feeless, many people believe that Nano is vulnerable to spam. There is some truth to this. [Nano was spam attacked recently](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/recent-dos-nano-network-attack-and-v21-3-fixes-97b9b7297f9), leading to degraded performance of the network. However, there are a few reasons that thinking Nano can (still) easily be spammed is mistaken:

1. While Nano is feeless, it is not free to transact. For every transaction, a small PoW has to be performed by your wallet. When you are a regular user, the wallet does this for you, and you don't notice it. When you try to do millions of transactions, this becomes more expensive.
2. Transactions in Nano used to be prioritised by PoW performed. If a spammer was spamming the network at PoW difficulty 1 (comparable to a fee paid of $0.0001), you could do PoW difficulty 2 (comparable to a fee paid of $0.0002) and get priority over the spammer. Following the spam attack, Nano is implementing even stronger spam resistance. [I've written a longer article on this here](https://senatus.substack.com/p/nanos-latest-innovation-feeless-spam), but in short transactions are getting prioritised by a combination of balance and time\_since\_last\_tx. Simply put, your priority is your balance \* time since use. For a spammer using small amounts to spam constantly, both balance and time since last use will be low, therefore the priority of the transaction is low. To have an impact while spamming the network, you therefore need to hold large amounts of Nano. This is expensive, as you need to first buy this Nano. It also means that if you spam the network to degrade performance, any price decrease will hurt you.

Conceptually, this defeats transaction flooding attacks by making it cost prohibitive to congest the network (i.e. you would need 50% of the supply to consume 50% of the throughput). The groundwork for implementing this operationally was laid in v22, but the final implementation is expected in the next update (v23).

**The goal of Nano**

Nano is intended to be [digital money for the modern world](https://nano.org/). It was freely given away to anyone willing to solve captchas. Because of this, [Nano was distributed](https://medium.com/nanocurrency/the-nano-faucet-c99e18ae1202) broadly and fairly, mostly to people in poorer countries. Because of its feeless nature, it’s well suited for lower-income countries. Because of being instant, it works as a medium of exchange, as money. Because there are no fees and there is no inflation, no money is lost when either [storing value in Nano](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8), or when using Nano.

[The vision of Nano](https://senatus.substack.com/p/the-vision-of-nano-an-instant-feeless) is broad. It allows for cheap remittances. Foreign workers pay [an average of 6.8%](https://migrationdataportal.org/themes/remittances) in fees to transfer money home. Nano can do this far more efficiently, both at lower cost and faster. It allows merchants to [start accepting payments](https://www.bitrequest.io/) anywhere in the world, instantly, without fees. It enables [streamers to receive feeless tips](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/comments/lrqhmu/i_made_a_twitch_bot_for_nano/), enables anyone [creating art or self-publishing](https://npass.dev/npass) to instantly take small (or large) payments for their works. It enables anyone suffering from hyperinflation to [securely store their money](https://senatusspqr.medium.com/why-nano-is-the-ultimate-store-of-value-and-reserve-currency-3b0318844bc8) in a currency whose supply can’t be increased. It allows charities to [take donations](https://nowpayments.io/supported-coins/nano-payments/) from all over the world. This means [less money going to middlemen](https://coindrop.to/), and more money arriving directly where it’s needed. Nano makes money efficient, frictionless, secure and borderless.

**So why hasn’t this taken off yet?**

I’m speculating here, but I think that many people have heard of Bitcoin. If you’ve spoken to someone about cryptocurrency, there’s a good chance they mentioned Bitcoin. Most people see Bitcoin just as an investment. A fraction of those who invest in it actually try to use Bitcoin, and most that do conclude that Bitcoin is slow and clunky. To many people, Bitcoin = cryptocurrency, and therefore all cryptocurrency must be slow and clunky. Nano’s claims seem outlandish after having experienced Bitcoin, and it’s easy to dismiss Nano as too good to be true. Hence my instruction, at the start of this post, on how to try Nano out for free, within 2 minutes. Since you probably skipped over it the first time, I’d like to end this article by saying that you spent so long reading this, you might as well try it out, for free!

1. Install [Natrium](https://natrium.io/).
2. Visit a [Nano Faucet](https://freenanofaucet.com/).
3. Fill in your Nano\_ address and hit send.

That’s all! To really try it out I’d recommend getting a second wallet such as [Nault (web-based)](https://nault.cc/) or [Nalli](https://nalli.app/), then sending some Nano from your first wallet to the second.

Most people that try Nano come into the [Nano subreddit](https://np.reddit.com/r/nanocurrency/) asking why Nano isn’t bigger yet. This is exactly why. Most don’t know about Nano yet, most haven’t tried it out yet. Nano has no marketing budget, no ads, no venture capital funding. Its marketing consists of Nano enthusiasts spreading the word, relying on word-of-mouth and organic growth. It relies on businesses starting to accept Nano payments because it saves on costs for them, on people using it because it’s the most efficient option. This tends to start off slower, but given the [explosive growth in Reddit subscribers](https://subredditstats.com/r/nanocurrency), the rapid addition of [businesses accepting Nano](https://wenano.medium.com/announcing-wenano-business-for-ios-and-android-80bf77b078b8), and the constant increase in projects built on Nano it seems faster growth is starting. All it takes to convince someone of Nano’s potential is to have them try it. That seems like a strong potential for growth to me.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

1. **Bitcoin (BTC):** the original cryptocurrency. The first Bitcoin was mined on January 3, 2009 and since then it has become much more of a Store of Value than a currency, given its scarcity and high security, although layer 2 solutions like the Lightning network allows for fast and cheap transactions.
2. **Ethereum (ETH):** the coin of the Ethereum blockchain, the first smart contract platform and the one having the biggest ecosystem of decentralized applications around: since ETH price is used to pay fees to interact with the network, a bigger ecosystem means higher demand. It is (and will be) used for staking in Ethereum 2.0 (which is PoS).
3. **Tether (USDT):** the most discussed stablecoin around, pegged to the dollar price although many believe it is not fully backed: for this reason its market cap has been decreasing for the first time ever and other stablecoins are gaining traction.
4. **Binance Coin (BNB):** the official Binance coin and the one used to pay fees on the Binance Smart Chain, a blockchain like Ethereum but less decentralized and with cheaper fees (not counting any layer 2 solutions).
5. **Cardano (ADA):** the coin of the PoS blockchain Cardano, created by the Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and developed strictly following peer-reviewed research, which slowed down development. Lots of partnerships and a big community make it one of the biggest ETH contenders.
6. **Ripple (XRP):** a centralized coin trying to redefine online payments, has had a rough time after the SEC went after it but seemingly it's coming out on top.
7. **USD Coin (USDC):** another stablecoin tied to the dollar and managed by the company Circle. Considered more trustworthy than Tether, it's been growing non-stop adoption-wise.
8. **Dogecoin (DOGE):** such wow, even higher ranking than last time. *sigh*
9. **Polkadot (DOT):** it's the coin of Polkadot, a multichain protocol aiming to connect different chains, both public and private, allowing to transfer data between one another or to create new custom blockchains. ChainLink's oracle pallet and Kusama are examples of projects built on top of it.
10. **Binance USD (BUSD):** another stablecoin pegged to the dollar, managed by Binance in partnership with Paxos.
11. **Uniswap (UNI):** the first token on the list, it's used to govern the decentralized trading protocol Uniswap, probably the biggest and most known DeFi application built on Ethereum.
12. **Bitcoin Cash (BCH):** a fork of Bitcoin trying to increase scalability and lower transaction fees increasing the blockchain block size, which achieves these features but reduces [decentralization](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=f32dac47-a7a6-4e5d-af5b-28e4f1d87287).
13. **Litecoin (LTC):** Bitcoin younger brother, been around since 2011. It's based on the Bitcoin code but with some tweaks, lowering transaction speed and cost, many sees it as the ""silver"" of crypto since it's been around for so long.
14. **Chainlink (LINK):** between one Ganon and the other Link is also the official token of ChainLink, a network that basically bridges off-chain data with smart contracts: an example is Synthetix, a derivatives protocol that uses Chainlink to get the price feed of a certain asset on their smart contract.
15. **Solana (SOL):** one of the latest Ethereum contenders, launched in 2020 and offering possibly the highest layer-1 thoughput of all (50k transaction per second!), but is still somewhat centralized (although this is being addressed) and has yet to build a competitive ecosystem.
16. **Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC):** it's a tokenized version of Bitcoin so it can be used on the Ethereum network and in DeFi applications.
17. **Polygon (MATIC):** the most popular layer-2 solution for Ethereum, Matic is the official coin of Polygon and used to pay fees on it: many Ethereum applications are moving there but it's still not easy to use with few exchanges supporting it directly.
18. **Ethereum Classic (ETC):** native token of the Ethereum Classic blockchain, a hard fork of Ethereum that claims to be more tied to Ethereum original plan. It has suffered various 51% attacks in the past years.
19. **Stellar (XLM):** created by an ex-Ripple founder, its aim is to become a currency and to allow to trade assets in a cheap and fast way. Last time I joked it was a 40c stablecoin, now I wished that held true.
20. **THETA (THETA):**  The token of THETA, a decentralized video delivery network (in a p2p fashion), used mainly for governance.
21. **DAI (DAI):** the biggest stablecoin not pegged 1-to-1 (or at least not claiming to) to the dollar, but soft-pegged and using cryptocurrencies deposited in smart contracts to collaterize the newly minted tokens.
22. **Internet Computer (ICP):** after its disastrous launch earlier this year, it almost overthrew Dogecoin as the biggest meme in the space. Jokes aside, it's a blockchain aiming to revolutionize the current internet, claiming to run at the same speed as the current web.
23. **VeChain (VET):**  Once everyone's favorite coin in this sub, was hit hard in the May crash and only lately recovering. Vechain is a blockchain focusing on business use-cases and supply chain management, VET (and VTHO) are the blockchain's official coins.
24. **Filecoin (FIL):**  the most popular IPFS (Interplentary File System), a peer-to-peer storage network without having to rely on cloud storage companies.
25. **TRON (TRX):** have you seen Silicon Valley, when they try to create a decentralized internet? Yeah, Tron's founder Justin Sun is like Jian-Yang, great at repackaging other projects (thanks to u/fbslo on the last post). Jokes aside, it's a blockchain platform for decentralized applications more focused on content sharing and entertainment.
26. **Monero (XMR):**  Monero's goal is  to allow transactions to take place privately and with anonymity. Even though it’s commonly thought that BTC can conceal a person’s identity, Monero obscures even senders and recipients whereas BTC doesn't.

32. **Axie Infinity (AXS):** without a doubt the most popular blockchain game, a mix of Pokémon and Tamagotchi that follows the Play-To-Earn model. AXS is the token used for governance and soon staking.
33. **PancakeSwap (CAKE):** the most popular decentralized exchange on the Binance Smart Chain, it started off as a copy of the Uniswap AMM model to then provide a variety of services.
34. **FTX Token (FTT):** the native token of the FTX platform, specialized in trading derivatives. It can be used as collateral or for discounts on trading fees.
35. **Bitcoin BEP2 (BTCB):** another tokenized version of Bitcoin, this time on the Binance Smart Chain.
36. **The Graph (GRT):**  It is an indexing protocol for querying networks like Ethereum and IPFS like Filecoin. Basically simplyfing the retrieval of data on blockchains for developers and applications.
37. **Algorand (ALGO):** founded by the MIT professor Silvio Micali, it's a PoS blockchain supporting smart contracts, with low fees and high throughput of operations.
38. **UNUS SED LEO (LEO):**  A utility token related to the iFinex ecosystem which allows you to save money on trading fees in Bitfinex. 
39. **Maker (MKR):** Maker is a token on the ethereum blockchain use for governance of the MakerDAO and Maker protocol, the organization behind the DAI stablecoin.
40. **Cosmos (ATOM):** dubbed the ""internet of blockchains"" by its founders, it solves the problem of interoperability between blockchains and provides tools to developers to build their own blockchains. Atom is the coin powering the platform and some notable projects built on top of it are Terra and Crypto.com chain.
41. **SHIBA INU (SHIB):** a meme coin that exploded in May, recently ShibaSwap was launched to give some sort of use-case to the coin which got a 3% score by DeFi Safety (later updated to 35%).
42. **Bitcoin SV (BSV):** a hard fork of a hard fork (BCH), it claims to be the true Satoshi Nakamoto vision of Bitcoin with an even bigger block size. Can't come up with a better joke than last time, I'm sorry.
43. **Tezos (XTZ):** another PoS Ethereum competitor. XTZ is the official coin used for governance and staking. One characteristic is that it is unforkable: it's impossible to create duplicates as instead happened with Bitcoin and Ethereum.
44. **Klaytn (KLAY):** a blockchain using a hybrid design between public and private chains, allowing anyone to create their own chain easily and without any technical knowledge, trying to appeal to companies and institutions mainly.
45. **NEO (NEO):**  *Noone can be told what it is, you'll have to see if for yourself.* Just kidding: launched in early 2014, it's a blockchain not too different from Ethereum where NEO is the coin used for governance. It has a Smart Economy System using digital assets (linked to a physical one) and verificable digital identities on smart contracts. 
46. **IOTA (MIOTA):**  open-source decentralized cryptocurrency engineered for the Internet of Things,  it uses a inventive blockless blockchain where users and verifiers of transactions are the same, with zero transactions fees and good scalability.
47. **Compound (COMP):** it's the governance token of Compound, a borrowing and lending platform not too different from Aave, launched in 2018 and with one of the biggest locked value of DeFi applications.
48. **TerraUSD (UST):** it's a decentralized algorithmic stablecoin pegged to the US dollar. It is available in different blockchains and it's getting more and more adoption, rising the price of Luna (which is directly tied to the demand for UST).
49. **Avalanche (AVAX):**  open-source platform aiming to become a global asset exchange. With an high throughput and good scalability, anyone can launch any form of asset and control it in a decentralized way with smart contracts. 
50. **Theta Fuel (TFUEL):** it's another native token of the Theta blockchain, it acts as a gas token to power the operations on the blockchain and is used for payments to relayers (users sharing their computing power).

I won't ever recommend any family member or friends to crypto ...

Edit: so this post blew up, I want to clarify few things :

- I clearly highlighted to them the risks and rewards of investing and the best investment is to invest in the tech of the coin by doing the right research first, that doesn't matter though since all they are seeing is the price NOW and all coins are down now. 
- I explicitly told them to avoid some scam coins such as bitconnect (and they did so thats good) but again it doesn't matter now since everything is down, the scam coins with the good coins. 
- No I don't expect people to thank me for introducing them to crypto, I only mentioned this part to highlight how they only remembered me when the market dipped. 
- I learned the lesson the hard way, so fuck me sideways if I ever try to talk about crypto to anyone else IRL again 
- Yes I believe the whole market will bounce back soon, do your own research on why crypto was created in the first place. 
- I won't recommend any coins here in this post because the point of this post is not shilling, please do your own research and decide 
- Remember, you only lose / profit when sell, all the numbers you see in your portfolio apps are just that, numbers. 


Original Post:

Mid November I started talking about crypto with my family and friends and gave them a little ""push"" to start investing small amounts to experiment... I wanted them to make some money because I know they could really use it and I explained how volatile the market rn and the rewards and risk they would have to take and strongly advised them to never ever invest what they can't afford to lose

Some of them got really invested and saw some big gains and started to show off their percentage gains on social media (which is stupid but whatever). 

Noone really thanked me for introducing them to crypto when they made some big gains, they all acted like they got into it because they were smart (before I introduced them to crypto they thought bitcoin was a physical golden coin and can't be bought in fraction), but again whatever I didn't do it for people to thank me I just wanted them to make some money because I know they needed some. 

Fast forward to today morning and FUCK.MY.LIFE I opened my phone and I find a barrage of messages from them accusing me of scamming them and tricking them into crypto because they lost money, I tried to explain to them that this is normal and it will bounce back soon and it's just a correction and don't sell but they aren't listening most of them sold and ""cut their loses"" before the ""bubble burst"".

I am never going to talk about crypto with anyone in real life again, fuck em I am not getting involved in this shitty situation ever again"

Before Kucoin was added as an exchange, I played around day trading on bitgrail to see if I could gain some more Nano. Turned out to be (probably) one of the worst decisions of my life. I've decided that the only way to deal with this is to move on as quickly as possible and keep making solid decisions. Negative emotions in times like these serve no one. I will continue to invest in cryptocurrency to the degree that I believe it has potential, and if it does, the worst decision I can make right now is stopping. I will be much, much more careful with exchanges in the future.

Bitgrail's statement on the hack can be found, here:
https://bitgrail.com/news

I've been trying to withdraw for a month, but their 10 BTC/day limit screwed me. I was verified quite early and had to pull out small amounts at a time for a very long time. Eventually, their 10 BTC/day limit tended toward something like 1 BTC, and my support tickets weren't answered.

This policy of allowing memes only on the weekend was adopted because the previous policy of only allowing two meme/COMEDY posts in the top 50 during the week and five meme/COMEDY posts on the weekend was prone to being gamed, and was a constant source of frustration for users who felt (fairly or unfairly) that the memes that did make it into the top 50 and stick didn't deserve to be there soaking up karma while their own precious creation was removed by a bot.

This proposal would disallow all simple image and gif posts in /r/CryptoCurrency. We would still allow COMEDY flaired posts in the main sub, such as [this one](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/luu7pa/english_is_outdated/), and those posts would be subject to the proposal that recently passed limiting karma to COMEDY flaired posts. However, direct link to an image, images, or gif would not be allowed to be posted in this subreddit.

Of course, we don't want to kill all memes (well maybe some mods do, but not all of us), so what we are proposing is to shift all memery to our sister subreddit /r/CryptoCurrencyMemes. In the immediate term the plan is to reward the top five meme posts in terms of upvotes that sub has at the end of each week UTC time with MOONs from the mod/community pot in the amount of 400, 250, 150, 100, 50 MOONs. In the medium term, let's say a month or two, we are hoping that we can define a way for these rewards to come directly from the monthly MOON distribution. We have had some preliminary discussion about this with admins and they seem onboard but would like to see the community define a distribution governance proposal and pass it to define exactly how this would be done.

Filecoin's Fully diluted marketcap at $417 Bn  is twice of Ethereum's marketcap.  

Most of FIL's supply is vested and being slowly released to early participants, ICO investors etc. 

If you are thinking about investing in FIL at this elevated level, you should consider all the aspects before jumping in."

People spout about which coin is hot. AAVE, COMP, ETH...is defi hot? Are nfts hot??? 

So here we have Biden suggesting a cap gains increase and everyone panic sells and rants about missing Trump. 

Do you realize how dumb you sound? Do you even realize that you are literally investing in the very solution to that problem? Did you even know what DeFi stands for or was it just a picture of a unicorn that got your attention?

Defi stands for DECENTRALIZED FINANCE. It means you have a bank, a lender, etc without a middleman. Bankless! And there are CeFi platforms as well that make it even easier!

What do these platforms do, you ask? (Since apparently none of you even bother to understand what you buy. You just cry and scream at the sky when number go down) 

Well, one thing you can do with lending platforms is use your crypto as collateral to take out loans against your crypto! 

and guess what the BEST part is...

...wait for it...

IT ISNT A TAXABLE EVENT. 

Yes. Let me repeat this again. You can have a bIg ole pile of crypto earning rewards and you can take out cash whenever you want and you dont pay taxes on it! And its lower fees than a bank and with defi even lower! Thats literally what you have been investing in the entire time you dolts!! 

It isnt called defi for no reason. Its DECENTRALIZED FINANCE! You can take out loans, earn interest, lend money across the planet. Biden cant touch it if you dont sell it. 

But if everyone PANIC SELLS than that fucks it up for everyone and for the people the angriest at Biden IT FUCKS IT UP FOR YOU THE MOST! 

This isnt wall street bets. This isnt a couch you are buying to flip. The goal is to stack crypto and take out loans against it (which is not a taxable event) or to escape your country’s shitty and predatory banking system! Thats why we are all here!  Its literally what the fucking sub is named. Look up in the top corner of your screen. It says CryptoCurrency! Read thag again a few more times. 

You arent hurting Biden by panic selling, you clowns! You are shooting yourself in the foot. 

Go watch some videos and educate yourself on taxes in crypto and how to avoid them. You can start a crypto IRA. You can simply stack on celsius/nexo/blockfi and take out low interest loans. 

ITS SURREAL TO WATCH THIS! 

Its like watching people investing in canoes and freaking out because their street is flooded and they are like “Well what the fuck are we supposed to do with all these canoes now?!!!”

This is like an IQ test that America failed. Its really sad to watch.

*Edit # 1: For the people saying I am being patronizing and angry. That was the point of the post! Look at all the learning going on in the comments. People are discovering research/google/youtube/websites that explain everything for the first time. Its like watching a caged bird fly! Im tearing up over here! 🥂🦅🕊🕊🕊🕊

*Edit # 2: This post wasnt made to claim that you will never pay taxes on any of your crypto profits. You absolutely will. (If you live in America) Staking rewards are taxed as well as things like Coinbase Earn but i I dont think you need to be worried about Biden’s tax proposal on your Coinbase Earn rewards you big whale you!! I figured this was self explanatory but apparently not.

*Edit # 3: Im not suggesting people take out high risk loans on their crypto to buy a pet ferret. Please learn to read!

*Edit # 4: Cefi loans are not taxable events. Defi loans can be. Thank you for people pointing this out. I am humbled.

*Edit #5: No this isnt me, but he breaks down some crypto lending options. Not financial advice**

My last post on securing accounts got a lot of attention, and there was also a lot of feedback and recommendations to add and consider. After that post I set out to make the most complete guide yet on securing your account and listing the resources needed.

**Email:**

* Email Providers
   * Any reputable email provider with 2FA will do
   * If you want to get more into privacy and encrypting emails there is [Protonmail](https://protonmail.com/) or [Preveil](https://www.preveil.com/)
   * You can alternatively also hook up your current email with the [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) email client (use to be managed by Mozilla Firefox) it is overseen by a volunteer board of contributors.
* 2FA - This is important, activating 2FA on your email is just as important as having it on exchanges. (Will cover more on 2FA further down)
* Create an email specifically for Crypto, but also avoid using crypto keywords / personal information in the email, treat your email address like its public information.
* Be on the lookout for Phishing emails, I made a post on how to identify phishing emails along with some useful tools here | [How to spot a phishing email](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/n0j8l0/tips_and_tricks_from_my_line_of_work_on_how_to/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) |
   * **Quick tips for emails:**
      * Don't trust email links
      * Double check the address bar of login pages
      * Know the [levels of a domain](https://hover.blog/whats-a-domain-name-subdomain-top-level-domain/)
      * Check to see if your crypto sites allow a anti-phish banner that displays a code with their emails that you set.
* [Tracking pixels](https://www.nutshell.com/blog/email-tracking-pixels-101-how-do-tracking-pixels-work/) are also a thing, there not malicious in themselves, but they can potentially let attackers know if you have open an email / let them know the email exist and is active.
* Furthermore You can check [haveibeenpwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) to see what data breaches your email has been apart of - If your email shows up and passwords are listed on the data that was compromised, ASSUME the worse and change the password and never use it again, along with any other accounts that use that password.

**Passwords / PINs:**

* Don't reuse them EVER
* Use strong secure passwords, passwords managers make these easy to manage and generate passwords.
* **This includes your phone and 2FA app**, if you have a weak pin (1234) for your phone and someone takes it, remember your 2FA app is then available (if same pin, or no pin/pass set), your email is automatically signed in (same for other accounts auto signed-in), and they can access your text messages.
* Don't use words relating to crypto or personal information in your passwords (or email), if they are compromised in a breach, assume they will search for these terms to target crypto users and try the same combo against crypto sites or figure who you based on the information (email & password) and pivot to finding public information that could lead to them answering challenge questions for password resets. (Your first pet, is it posted on Facebook? How about your car? Your first girlfriend/boyfriend?)
* Password Managers: These work wonders when managing passwords securely. They generate random strong passwords which can be adjusted, and its all kept in an encrypted database file, so even if a attacker gets access to it, they won't be able to access it without the password.
   * Password Managers trusted by the community:
      * [KeePass](https://keepass.info/)
      * [BitWarden](https://bitwarden.com/)
      * [LastPass](https://www.lastpass.com/)
      * [1Password](https://1password.com/)
* Don't save passwords in your browser
   * Does it require verification for you to use the password? Also I tend to find extensions being more buggy as they have to interact with more 'moving' parts and changing configurations, and generally more people try to target and exploit browsers.

**2 Factor Authentications (2FA):**

* Enable on everything possible (Email, Exchanges, Banks, Robinhood, even Reddit to protect your moons)
* Use 2FA Apps instead of SMS whenever possible, [SIM Swap](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/blog/2019/10/sim-swap-scams-how-protect-yourself) attacks are real, and more common than you think.
   * 2FA Apps
      * [Authy](https://authy.com/) (Linux | Windows | macOS | Iphone | Android)
      * [Google Authenticator](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/1066447) (iOS | Android)
      * [Microsoft Authenticator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/account/authenticator) ( iOS | Android)
      * [LastPass Authenticator](https://www.lastpass.com/how-lastpass-works) (Browser Extension | iOS | Android | Windows Phone)
* Hardware Keys
   * These are [physical 2FA device](https://www.techradar.com/best/best-security-key) (I chose this list as I think it does a good job explaining them with pros and cons, I did NOT vet the sellers that are listed on the amazon links. Always research and buy from a reliable source)
* Backup codes:
   * When you activate 2FA on any account you should have the ability to generate backup codes, these are used incase you lose access to your authenticator, TREAT these like your seed phrases. Use them by logging in with your user and pass, and use these backup codes in place of the 2FA code you usually enter.
* DO NOT take pictures of your QR codes, if you screenshot it, might end up syncing somewhere you don't want it to and if it ever gets compromised they have the ability to continually receive your 2FA code.
* Also, DO NOT sign up for your 2FA app or any crypto service for that matter using your work or school email address. You lose access to that email, then consider all accounts gone as you won't be able to access the codes if you switch devices.

**Wallets**

* Learn the difference between the different wallets, I think this [article](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/article/hot-wallets-vs-cold-wallets-whats-the-difference) is REALLY good at going in depth about the differences and pros vs cons of them at a beginner level.
* Cold wallets will always be more secure than any hot wallets as they aren't connected to the internet
   * Top trusted hardware wallets from the community:
      * Ledger
      * Trezor
* Verify the details you are confirming on your hardware wallet device. the wallet app interacting with your cold wallet device could be compromised, but you would still be safe using it, as long as you verify each action on the cold wallet device, and reject the transaction if anything seems off. (Thanks keeri)

**Seed Phrases: Treat these as they are the keys to the kingdom (Keep offline and out of your notes app)**

Less Secure:

* Write down on paper and either break up the phrase and place in separate secure locations or hide them like the the FBI is going to come search your house
* Secure on USB

1. Get a [file shredder](https://fileshredder.org/) (securely deletes data, and overwrites it)
2. Download password manager (optional)
3. Disconnect device from internet
4. Enter seed phrase into password manager / create encrypted file
5. Put on a freshly reformatted USB / datalocker (Worms like to spread by USB)
6. Save to USB, and shred the original using the file shredder software
7. Hide USB

* Another device / old phone

1. Factory reset
2. Set Pin / Pass
3. Download 2FA app and password manager / file encryption tool
4. Disconnect from internet FOR GOOD (Treat this like a cold wallet)
5. Back up 2FA and seed phrases
6. Hide device

More secure (more expensive):

* [BlockPlate](https://www.blockplate.com/pages/getting-started-blockplate)
* [CryptoSteel](https://cryptosteel.com/how-it-works/?v=7516fd43adaa)
* Have a copy saved in a safety deposit box / split between two banks.

NOTE: Each method is going to its pros and cons: Getting robbed, fading ink, the elements, data retention (USB \~10 years), ever being on a digital machine. Pick which ones benefits you the most, and correlates with your budget and what your willing to risk.

**VPNs / TOR:**

* Privacy vs Anonymity
   * Privacy is the ability to keep your data and information about yourself exclusive to you (They know who you are, but not what you do).
   * Anonymity is about hiding and concealing your identity, but not your actions. (They know what you do, but not who you are)
   * Think about what your goal is, I commonly associate privacy with VPN and anonymity with TOR
      * Both encrypt your data before leaving your device, then routes it through proxy servers to mask your IP/Location. VPNs you have to trust the provider (ensure they state there is a no log policy) while TOR runs through servers ran by volunteers (don't think governments don't run their own) and lets you access the dark web. [Here is a more in-depth comparison on VPN vs TOR](https://www.comparitech.com/blog/vpn-privacy/tor-vs-vpn/).
      * Personally Its worth paying the few bucks a month for a paid tier of the VPN service.
* VPN Providers - Zero log VPN services:
   * [ProtonVPN](https://protonvpn.com/)
   * [Nord](https://nordvpn.com/)
   * [Mullvad](https://mullvad.net/en/)
* TOR
   * Brave offers TOR, but I would treat this more like a VPN
   * If being anonymous is your goal the only real way to achieve this is running [Tails off a USB](https://tails.boum.org/).

**NOTE:** Some exchanges and websites blacklist IP ranges associated with VPN and most commonly TOR for security reasons. Some people on this community stated that this can lead to them freezing your account.

**Browsers (Excluding TOR):**

* Top 3 Browsers built for privacy
   * Firefox
   * Epic

* Search Engine for privacy: DuckDuckGo
* Extensions
   * One of the most dangerous threats I think that aren't taken seriously are extensions. These can start out legitimate, then through an update turn malicious. These will then be removed from the webstore, but not your browser.
      * Some will be removed the store due to not being supported anymore which = no more updates, and no more updates = vulnerabilities that won't be fixed
      * If you have Google Sync activated, these extensions will also sync to all those devices
   * Remove any extensions you don't need, check to see there still available on the store, and even search them to see if some security [article like this pops up](https://duo.com/labs/research/crxcavator-malvertising-2020) about it.
   * Check the privacy practice tab of the extension to see what data it collects.

**Checking and verifying hashes of a download:**

Hashes are the fingerprint of a file, even if you change the name of the file the hash will be the same. This is similar to how wallets work, its a string of characters and numbers, yet represents data (aka your holdings)

* How to get hash:
   * Go to the search bar in windows and enter ‘cmd’ this should bring up the command prompt (open terminal on Linux / MAC)
      * type “Certutil -hashfile Desktop\\example.txt sha256” for windows
      * type ""Sha256sum Desktop\\example.txt"" for Linux
      * type “shasum -a 256 Desktop\\example.txt” for MAC
      * (Remove quotes, and replace 'Desktop\\example.txt"" with the path to the file you want to check)
* this should give you the sha256 hash you can copy and paste into [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72714927de74b97c524c5fa8bc1a0dec83f038dbbed80b93b5e6280ca1317f41/detection) to check to see if its known as malicious by many security vendors. Here is the hash and VirusTotal link for the shredder download I previously mentioned in the seed back up step. [72714927de74b97c524c5fa8bc1a0dec83f038dbbed80b93b5e6280ca1317f41/detection](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/72714927de74b97c524c5fa8bc1a0dec83f038dbbed80b93b5e6280ca1317f41/detection)

**NOTE:** You can also just submit the file to VirusTotal, but if it potentially contains personal information, it will upload the file and allow other people to download it, searching the hash will not do this.

**Other General Safety Tips:**

* [Harden your PC](https://www.securicy.com/blog/security-best-practices-hardening-windows-10/) (Guide is for Windows 10, but can translate to other OS)
   * Update OS and any software // turn on automatic updates - Everything you download is an attack vector
   * Set firewall rules - Default deny, open only p855orts you need, disable rules you don't need
   * disable remote access
   * Install AV // Malwarebytes for removing malware
   * Turn on encryption
   * Setup user accounts // privileges'
   * Strong password
* Whitelist addresses if possible (Some exchanges allow you to designate a address as 'safe' any other transactions besides those won't go through)
* If you use a encrypted messaging service, I highly recommend [Signal](https://www.signal.org/), if you haven't seen their [reply regarding a subpoena](https://signal.org/bigbrother/central-california-grand-jury/) you should
* Lock down your social media accounts (go to security settings, turn off being able to be found via search engine, ad related settings, change who can view your posts, etc)
* Don't disclose your holdings and earnings
* Don't access your crypto on your work computer
* Don't answer PMs about winning some contest or some amazing opportunity

**Phone:**

Many users asked about security regarding people who mainly use their phones. Many of these tips can translate to phones as well, but here's a quick rundown.

* Unique pin / password for the phone
* download a password manager
* email account purely for crypto
* pin / password (different than getting into your phone) for your 2FA app.
* Don't lend phone out
* Avoid apps you don't need, read the 3 star reviews as they are the most honest)
* Download VPN / be aware of the wifi your connecting to
* Be aware of phishing
* Call your service provider and see if they can lock your SIM card and prevent SIM swapping.

NOTE: These are still just suggestions, these are methods that balance security and usability. One could use 2 password managers and split a password between both, but that would compromise usability / ease of use."

"For the first time in my life I could purchase Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero from a crypto ATM here in Geneva (Switzerland).

Cash only, you are given a qr code with a public key to send and receive the amount your purchased. The machine was operated by Bity, and for any purchase of Bitcoin I was asked a fee of 4 chf.

This is truly astonishing considering that 10 years ago buying Bitcoin was almost like using limewire. Gradually, I hope to see more ATMs pop up and enable people to invest without having to disclose all your personal information on sites like coinbase or binance.

Mass adoption is really around the corner, and with more and more people jumping on board, I do believe crypto ATM will be a bridge of accessibility. When crypto will become a useable currency in major stores these will become essential!

Edit: Thank you all for taking the time to leave a comment and for the awards and upvotes! 
I must clarify that the reason I made this post was literally because I think it’s useful for all of us to hear, discuss and argue about crypto ATMs and debate on accessibility of crypto to the public and investors, and also to help fellow noobs (like myself) and non-noobs discover something we didn’t know much about until now. I literally found out about this ATM not even two days ago....
Also, how freaking cool is it that you can buy crypto from an ATM?! Come on, that’s just awesome (with pros and cons I hear you). 

Edit2: For all those that are upset I didn’t cross post from the other subreddits I posted at - my bad, didn’t know I could do that!"
Which is better: Buying Top Coins vs. Buying BTC & ETH - (a 6 years DCA case study),2968,ofu03b,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ofu03b/which_is_better_buying_top_coins_vs_buying_btc/,amashq,1625697794.0,False,FOCUSED-DISCUSSION,t3_ofu03b,False,598,False,0.97,"Inspired by [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oen5zp/bought_top_20_coins_100_each_will_update_in_an/), I built a script to analyse if you DCA'd blindly in the top crypto coins vs. investing in BTC & ETH vs investing only in BTC since the beginning of 2015, how much would your total worth is. Here are the results.

**Numbers & assumptions:**

* DCAing takes place every week, on 1st, 8th, 15th and 22th of every month starting from Jan 1st 2015 and until July 6th 2021.
* Investments budget per week is $100.
* The weekly investment is divided equally on the coins invested in.
* This case study is ignoring stable coin investments. E.g.: investing in the top 5 coins means the top 5 coins excluding any stable coins.
* The analysis is assuming that you invested your money and never sold any coin till now.
* Total invested money over the whole DCA period is $31,300.
* Transaction fees are not included in the analysis.

**Here are the results:**

* If you blindly DCA into the top 1 coins (BTC), you will end up with **$1,102,104**.
* If you blindly DCA into the top 2 coins, you will end up with 4 coins (BTC, XRP, LTC, ETH) in your wallet and total worth of **$1,462,443**.
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 3 coins**, you will end up with 11 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,310,552.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 5 coins**, you will end up with 23 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,490,189.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 7 coins**, you will end up with 37 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,923,849.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 10 coins**, you will end up with 55 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$2,316,169.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 20 coins**, you will end up with 130 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$1,619,756.**
* If you blindly DCA into the **top 50 coins**, you will end up with 381 coins in your wallet, and a total worth of **$979,086.**
* If you had a glass ball and knew that ETH will be what it's today and you invested only in BTC & ETH, you will end up with 2 coins in your wallet (surprise), and a total worth of **$4,505,477.**

**Some observations:**

1. Although it was relatively easier to guess that BTC will be the #1 crypto coin back then, nobody would have guessed for sure that ETH will be #2, so betting on BTC & ETH only from the beginning would've been your strategy only if you know the future. (you are God). Based on that it's safer to say ""I invest in the top X coins"" instead of saying I only invest in coin X and coin Y.
2. Investing in altcoins in addition to BTC can increase your ROI considerably. Investing in top 7-10 coins tends to yield the most return in this case study (x3).
3. Based on #2, a crypto ETF (or a similar service from exchanges that allow us to buy in bulk) could give exposure to the top X coins while saving transaction costs considerably.

If you want more details, here is what your wallet would look like in each case of the above:

"For anyone on the fence due to the recent BNB price spike, BSC is just Ethereum with a higher gas limit at the expense of centralization.

That couldn't be further from the truth.

BSC is an Ethereum clone and all they did to reduce fees was increase the gas limit. That means that more transactions can be processed for lower fees but it requires more powerful hardware and thus more centralization. Ethereum could do this in 10 minutes if they thought that was beneficial to the network but they haven't because doing so would break a lot of the decentralization and security of the network.

Ethereum is so widely used and trusted **because** it is so decentralized and secure.

Ethereum has the most developers and researchers working on it than any other blockchain project by a very long way which means it is literally the bleeding edge of crypto tech. The Eth killers have a long way to go to knock it off as king of DeFi.

That's not to say that ADA and DOT aren't very promising projects but putting BSC/BNB in with them is almost laughable. It's just a clone! It will always be behind.

 - loan paid off was originally 8.5%, refinanced to 4.5% in 2019. And yeah, I *will* be a little sour if Biden ends up wiping away everyone’s student loans after this haha but it is what it is, and this was a guaranteed weight off my back
 - most of what I sold was ETH, but also some Bitcoin and Cardano. Without getting into specifics, I was up ~15x my initial investment when I sold. 
 - Will probably re-enter during the next bear market, in the meantime I’ll be cheering y’all on and saving up on the sidelines

1. Yeah, I paid the taxes.
2. About jumping out in a bull market:

3. Some highlights of these 3 years:

Please, this is not a financial advice.

I started reading a lot about BTC and other top10 coins. Invested in some alts because, for me back in 2017, BTC was also too high at 10-20k.

So, I picked up coins with a good product/idea and company/team behind it. Examples are: IOTA, XRP (at least in my first readings), XMR. Because I joined in quite early, I didn't lose money with XRP, for example, but I did with IOTA (because of the timing).

In the bear market, I put some money in BTC as well -- monthly, yeah. Then, started to look for microcap projects, such as BOMB, Parachute token, Uptrennd, XIO etc. Making part of these microcap communities is a good way to make some extra and know some good people. Of course, be very aware of scams.

Today, I wish I could have done some things different:

1. Don't fall in love with an asset (and sell or exchange them for profit);
2. Bitcoin is the most resillient coin around, so it would be much less stressful if I had more BTC instead of alts;
3. Don't be too greedy and profit all over the bullrun;
4. DCA is the best strategy, as most of you pointed out;
5. Don't hodl when the bear market starts (these were the longest 3 years in my life lol). I would sell everything back in Q1 2018 to return months or years later.

Thanks for your kind words. And yes,  this is why we crypto!"

After countless hours of research on the various industries being disrupted, after reading whitepapers, parsing through the profile of team members, watching recorded conferences and making calculations based on demand and market size, I can write with full confidence that the overwhelming majority of the community of crypto investors is retarded. Never have I seen a market that is less focused on growth objectives, or that circlejerks harder to news and announcements whose impact they don't even try to measure or fully understand.

In all honesty, it's not *that* surprising. The tech itself is more or less difficult to understand (anyone with an engineering, computer science, economics or finance background *should* be able to grasp the underlying concepts and realize why distributed ledgers have vale, despite not being familiar with every key concept) but the extremely hard part is picturing exactly how efficiencies are bound to be created on an industrial level, and how impactful they will be. In other markets, this is why there exist ratings, panels of experts, consulting groups. They perpetually gauge the health of various industries and make predictions based on trends, to help others make informed decisions. Even then, a layer of speculation (and thus, manipulation) always exists, but the ratio of speculation vs. real demand tends to be in a different league entirely.

Despite knowing or suspecting this, however, the same shit happens **every time** here. Bitcoin starts to drop, and the trolls come out of the woods to spread their depressive thoughts onto everyone else. Altcoins start to shine, and the morons who bought during the frenzy and are seeing 10% gains for the first time in weeks, months, if not ever, start tugging each other and patting themselves in the back and writing essays as to why DPoS experiment #898 (which doesn't even have a main net yet) is on track to being massively adopted and is *definitely* the best buy opportunity of the decade. Bitcoin starts to rise again, and suddenly all money floods from the rest of the market to feed Big Daddy and every single other project is a shitcoin again and they'll never amount to anything ever.

It is beyond frustrating to see how easily everyone is being manipulated. Short-term fluctuations in the market doesn't make you right, and it doesn't make you wrong either. There are basically *zero* candid discussions on the state of the technology and ***how it stands relative to adoption.*** There are basically *zero* attempts to map out the ecosystem in a comprehensive way so that 'investors' can have a clear picture of how some projects might interact with each other, allowing us to formulate enlightened guesses as to how much market share each might capture. Nobody seems to give a shit about decentralization *at all*, but I suspect for the vast majority, it was never about freedom and fairness, only profits.

Everybody strictly only celebrates when the market moves up without ever questioning the validity of that movement. When an asset inflates without any fundamental reason, its only achievement is the creation of a bubble that will inevitably result in severe losses for the majority of investors. 

With the size of this community (this subreddit alone), we have the power to warn others and to influence the market by infusing some rationality into it. So please, take the time to encourage others to look beyond immediate gains and to research the field. Take the time to criticize twitter ""influencers"". Take the time to reach out to professors, industry professionals and other knowledgeable experts to ask them their thoughts about specific projects and the market as a whole. We desperately need to create a global stage on which there is informed discourse, else this market will never truly grow."

**\_\_\_**

This hack happened on October 14, 2018. I woke up early in the morning my local time. Right away I turned on the laptop and checked my inbox where I discovered the abnormally large volume of letters from the COSS Exchange. There were a few thousands of them. Each letter informed me about a failed attempt to enter my account on the Exchange.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/g77PukIXek90mSkixZD00gDe3rWskh](https://monosnap.com/file/g77PukIXek90mSkixZD00gDe3rWskh)

[https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V](https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V)

I received all of the e-mails when I slept. I rushed to check the account and discovered that all my holdings were gone. More specifically, they were sold on low-liquid markets at the rates substantially lower than the market ones.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f](https://monosnap.com/file/ZF2LuWlV5rbwsO6FycUu4mea9ByL2f)

In no time I turned to the support of the Exchange and informed about the incident. I wrote about this situation on Reddit and in the public Telegram group of the Exchange. Naturally, the first reaction that I experienced from the community was humiliation and accusations of stupidity. Many called me a dumb fool because I stored funds on the Exchange and so on. No need to point out how I kept the funds. I have what I have now. So on a weekly basis, the Exchange shares the trading fees with the holders of its tokens. The profit is distributed among token holders proportionally to the number of tokens they possess. That's why I decided to keep my tokens with COSS exchange.

The exchange claims:

[https://medium.com/@coss.io/coss-io-october-24th-2018-updates-180ca2bb003b](https://medium.com/@coss.io/coss-io-october-24th-2018-updates-180ca2bb003b)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/bXFU7D1CQamFzrZpi8TRskjqsiW1C2](https://monosnap.com/file/bXFU7D1CQamFzrZpi8TRskjqsiW1C2)

They forgot to mention one small fact that access to my account was received using vulnerability which allowed hacker to perform brute force attack on my 2FA.

I was not the only victim as COSS declares in their medium blog and hacker indeed used exchange’s vulnerability:  
[https://monosnap.com/file/X48I4OrgYBgw5vAORRQLJtrcved06l](https://monosnap.com/file/X48I4OrgYBgw5vAORRQLJtrcved06l)  
COSS Exchange was under DDOS + Brute force attack

They’ve shut down an entire exchange for \~24 hours:  
[https://monosnap.com/file/7AHQbzugClSxUwlx2lHFIpadtxhiqv](https://monosnap.com/file/7AHQbzugClSxUwlx2lHFIpadtxhiqv)

What was that if not an exchange’s vulnerability?

The Exchange claims that the hacker had my password. Of course, the most natural and the easiest thing is to accuse the user of being responsible for the accident. But I can assure you that it is far from being the case. I have been in this industry since the end of 2011, and I do know how to generate and store wallets, passwords etc. I neither use Android smartphones, nor computers with Windows OS. I do not use SMS 2FA. I am meticulous and do not do bullshit. What if it was some internal job? Or users data base leaked? Ok, let's assume that I happened to become a victim/target of a hacker, who somehow managed to access my login and password (what I doubt A LOT). However, I had a 2FA verification installed for this occasion.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V](https://monosnap.com/file/79XrZrCLUTYWyjqRbWpMdbw5sGEi0V)

It was designed exactly for the situations like the one I described above. 2FA enables to keep the funds safe even if the password/login was compromised. Recently I received a report from COSS compliance, in which they admitted that the brute force attack took place. After 25,000 trials the attack was successfully completed.  
[https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO](https://monosnap.com/file/va2jo4vKoY8BMpCiqVr2lp7AGT8AvO)

The hacker got the access to my account and sold all my funds for nothing. After all the Exchange ignores my messages about refund and steps towards that. They’ve only stated amount of assets they were able to recover and  
[https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO](https://monosnap.com/file/K53lHFblRaeOLIVt6CUAF3P4tvE2LO)

claiming that it was the user's (mine) fault that the hacker managed to access the funds.[https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV](https://monosnap.com/file/McRLu9kY0vZuSGmVqU3ViDa2IljTkV)

How come? How would the hacker have accessed the funds if the Exchange had not allowed to perform the brute force attack? Even if it was me who had compromised the password in some magic way, 2FA had to serve the last stand. The hacker managed to brute force it using Exchange’s vulnerability and the Exchange has not stopped the brute force attack. Remember, there were 25,000 trials  
[https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa](https://monosnap.com/file/w1OOclQrPSuJFY4GzSpHCHABipfgKa)

If I had additional time, I would manage to respond and prevent the hack. Even if there was my fault, but only 50%, the other half is that exchange gave the opportunity to the hacker to brute force 2FA. In this regard, I publicly call the COSS Exchange to refund me at least 50% of my account's balance.

Assets I had:

\~11 700 000 coss tokens (30kk$ at ATH period)

\~14 BTC

19 000 eos to refund in full (EOS node was down and hacker wasn’t able to withdraw EOS)  
[https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ](https://monosnap.com/file/kv0QqQd9nsLszRAJFE5vzJKx8J5aLQ)

\~ 22 ETH

The Exchange should bear the sole responsibility for the accident if its internal vulnerability allowed the hacker to accomplish his/her brute force attack.

If it would be possible to bypass 2FA protection with a brute force attack, every exchange/platform, as well as 2FA providers (generally Google), would be brought into disrepute and would face severe claims from their users. Basically, the whole industry would become a mess. If the case, exchanges/platforms would suffer multi-billion dollar losses, in particular, translating into even more significant losses for the industry as a whole.

No matter what decision COSS exchange will take I call other exchanges to add an extra security feature to protect user’s funds. TRADING PASSWORD. This will prevent anybody to sell user’s assets on the low liquidity markets for cents even if the password was compromised and exchange grants brute force attacks.

I’m not promoting anybody, just facts:

They manipulate markets, using the media, and they shake out the weak hands so they can scoop up everything they want for fractions of the price. The shit thing is it's working. Those guys you saw buying lambos and bullshit at the end of last year are the ones who didn't panic sell after the Mt Gox crash thinking ""Atleast I'll come out of this with something"". Look at the volumes at the moment, look at the amount of coins being accumulated right now, who do you think are the ones doing that? You think a bunch of investors with deep pockets just stumbled ass-backwards into the market and don't bother reading the news? Think. If you're selling right now you are selling to rich guys that know something you don't. 

Put the phone down, go an do whatever it was you were doing before crypto for the next month, for the next three months even. Or don't, panic sell to guys that know exactly what they are doing and lament it at the end of the year. We all saw the comments and posts of people warning that after the bull market will come days when everything drops 20% round the board. Well those days are here. No one ever got rich panic selling.  

I'm not frustrated cause my portfolio is dropping, it'll be back. I'm frustrated because all of us little guys have the possibility to ride this wave up because we got here early, and we're dropping like flies at the moment.

It was a pic of someone holding up their paper wallet from a bitcoin atm showing both public and private keys. The picture made me wonder if there were any nearby bitcoin atms, so I did a quick google search and found an atm 20 minutes away from me. I went to the atm and put in 50$ just to say that I had some bitcoin. I signed up for /r/bitcoinbeginners and learned about Coinbase. After signing up with Coinbase, I started researching the ""other"" crypto being offered and learned about /r/cryptocurrency. I started buying eth at 8$ and eventually invested 30% of my net worth in crypto. 

I stuck with eth during lows & highs and yes I do regret sometimes not selling at top during last bull run. This month I decided that I wanted to set a baseline on what I would get with my crypto investment. I sold enough eth and bitcoin to pay off the mortgage to my house and compensate for taxes. Today I went to the bank and turned in my final house payment. No matter what happens to crypto from here on out, I have a house. Paying off the house was never a goal for 2020. Hell, it wasn't even a goal for the next decade.

Do I think ETH will hit above $1400 again? Yes, and it might happen next week or next year or half a decade. I've never doubted the technology. However, getting rid of my mortgage takes an immediate, priceless weight off my shoulders. I work in an industry where layoffs always seem to be on the horizon, and it's hard to get a job when everyone is out of a job. Now I don't have to worry about keeping a roof over my family's head. The relief is euphoric.

I'm not completely off the crypto ride. I still have a good amount of eth left. I'm going to invest a small amount per month back into eth and bitcoin to slowly build my stockpile back up, but I'm not in any rush.

It really makes no sense to me. Dont get me wrong i lo e a good laugh and i will upvote if something made me laugh but sometimes im really confused.

Are bots involved or how does this happen. The upvote difference between 50 and 12 thousand is pretty large and considering we have millions of members its pretty bizzare to me."

A guide to replacing your full time job with Reddit MOONs,2813,my5mdk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/my5mdk/a_guide_to_replacing_your_full_time_job_with/,NotRandyRandom,1619346641.0,False,MOONS 🌕,t3_my5mdk,False,806,False,0.93,"this is in no way shape or form a good idea, just thought i'd post this here because it's 6am and im doing fucking math on reddit crypto lmao.

&#x200B;

Anyways, right now a moon is worth about 8 cents. If you wanted to replace your full time job with raking in moons on reddit, it would take a lot of time and effort but here we go.

The average hourly wage in the USA is \~$15. This means that at that wage you are making about 31,000 dollars a year. Now, going off of the math of 1 upvote = 0.48 moons (credit to /u/pkg322 because i saw that on one of their comments.), this means that 1 upvote is just under 4 cents.

Now, your yearly wage of 31,000 dollars divided by 8 cents (1 moon) means that you would need to acquire a total of 387,500 moons per year in order to sustainably replace your full time job. This is also equivalent to...

\- 32,291.67 moons per MONTH

\- 1061.64 moons per DAY

\- 44.24 moons per HOUR

&#x200B;

This also means that you need \~90 upvotes per hour to replace your full time job.

have fun with this knowledge bois

EDIT: I have learned there is a cap of 15k moons per month per account, this is still equivalent to $1.2k per month. Pretty pog.

Update: haha, 30 upvotes in the past hour.. that's like a whole moon.. my ploy to become the greatest moon farmer is coming to fruition!

Update 2: ok for real y'all are making me rich out here, also thanks for the awards friends!

Update for everyone saying ""you have to farm 24 hours a day this is stupid"": You only need to post a few good posts and then people can upvote it at any time... It doesn't just disappear lol"

3.  I bought Baidu (the Chinese Google) stock the day it IPOed for $80.  A couple of weeks later it was at $60 and I sold my holdings.  It then went to $1,000/share and split 10 for 1.

There are countless others, too.

I own a barbershop in U.K and I have now started to accept cryptocurrency as payments for haircuts. I have been doing this for years now but on and off, I always wanted to make it known to all customers that this is possible with the right cryptocurrencies. At the moment I am accepting only NANO due to its speed and fees compared to other cryptos. I use NANO's official app and the customers who would like to pay in crypto know about it. For other currencies like BTC, ADA, ETH etc.. I will be using my wallets like Atomic, Trust and or exchanges like [Crypto.com](https://Crypto.com) & Coinbase. 

I have around 8 customers right now that pay only in crypto and hopefully there will be more. I charge £15 for a haircut but if you pay in crypto I lower it to £12. I have posters made for the shop so that when we re-open on 12th April all customers can see and hopefully start to look into investing and using crypto themselves. Bitcoin has changed my life, I bought my business and home because of it so I am always going to be a big fan.

Thank you for reading, any questions please feel free to ask.

Edit: wow thank you so much for the kind words and confidence all I was not expecting this. A few have asked about the shop and here is our website please feel free to visit. www.amgbarbers.com.

If you want to see where this sub is heading. Simply look at the rest of Reddit.

Moons haven't fundamentally changed anything. They have the same effect as karma points, maybe just more amplified and a little more greed-driven with the monetary incentive added. But the farming is not new, and it's all the same mechanism.

If you look around Reddit, it's not always quality content that gets the most votes and visibility. It's popularity. And there's always the same handful of topics that keep getting the most votes, along with whatever meme and fad is going on at the time.

That's the future of Moons. It's not gonna be so much a reward for quality but popularity.

The more new people we have, the more it's gonna skew towards popularity. But don't worry, you'll still get upvotes for quality. And there will be people like me handing you awards, and downvoting populist garbage to try to even things out.

# The karma:

There's a common misconception that karma = upvotes. That's not the case. We know karma is not 1:1 with votes, we just don't know the numbers. It's done with an algorithm. Reddit favors upvotes over downvotes. So downvotes don't weigh as much. Voting manipulation is also clamped down in your karma. Unbalanced users who heavily downvote, or heavily upvote, may have their votes weigh less.

And the more votes a post gets, the less those votes weigh. So 100 upvotes may get you close to 100 karma. But 20,000 upvotes may only get you under 6,000 karma:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5bislo6au5e71.png?width=2750&format=png&auto=webp&s=4c946e33d4e5234351cc29821542fc127ca68efc

# The Downvotes:

Because moon distribution is based on karma and not upvotes, a lot of those nasty downvote bots and mass downvoters don't actually get counted. So we are pretty safe from downvotes, even if we can't see it.

You may see your posts get a lot of 0 and -1, but your karma may actually be well into the positives. Ever noticed distributions like the last one, where the downvoting was really heavy handed, yet got a lot more karma than expected? You can thank the Reddit algorithm for that.

Mass downvoters weigh very little on your karma. And it works too with voting manipulation of people upvoting their own posts, or small groups of people upvoting each other.

That's why it's not a good idea to replace the karma system for Moons, for a system that only counts upvotes, as some proposals have tried to do. Because then there's no algorithm anymore to stop voting manipulation.

*edit: while downvotes are probably not affecting karma as much as many people think, they are stil an issue for post visibility. That's why it's a good idea to check NEW for good quality posts, and help those with awards. Awards don't count towards Moons, but help with visibility.* 

# Who are the downvoters:

In this part I don't have a lot of facts. I'm gonna get more into speculation, so take it with a pinch of salt.

If you're wondering where the downvoting comes from, it's probably not bots. People who were here last November will probably know what bots downvoting looks like. Every single comment in the daily is in the negatives, with half of them being -5 or more. It's possible that bots may have been more discrete now. But why use a bot just to downvote in small quantities.

The downvoting probably comes in big part from brigading. There's a lot of maximalist subs that hates this sub. Many are aware of our moons and think they can downvote them away. Safemoon has a serious grudge against us, because we keep mentioning they are a scam. And they frequently talk about us. And there have been posts on there for brigading this sub. Others like Shiba army hates us for the same reason. The increase in downvote  seem to have also coincided with the drop of Doge.

Another source of downvoters comes from people from our sub. And for the Daily Discussion, it seems to come from a group who use mostly just the main page. Some of them have expressed a degree of contempt for the Daily. Even trying to push proposals targeting people in the Daily. Their aim is to reduce the karma earned there, so they can get a bigger share of the distribution with their posts. There is an easy way to moon farm on there by just copy and pasting links every day. And the karma earned by the big activity in the Daily gets in the way of that.

# Moon Farming

Moon participation is not the same thing as moon farming. The term moon farming is now being used for anyone who is just participating a lot. When moon farming was originally designating people who use more subversive methods, like plagiarized content, even reposting other users popular posts, fake sob stories, or heavily commenting and posting links. And anything like easy moon farming techniques, like complaining about downvotes and claiming they are upvoting every posts.

Moon farming is not gonna go away. It's part of the sub now. So it's something we'll have to accept.

Votes aren't gonna be enough to stop them, since they are subversive about it, and will even post popular topics. There is a the 1K post limit, and the 15K karma limit that keep them from having too big of an effect on the distribution. There is probably still a need to limit number of comments, and also stop counting karma for deleted posts. It's too easy for them to repost popular links, memes, etc, that will get a lot of upvotes, and get deleted much later. But they keep the karma, and keep on spamming that stuff.

I think in the future some degree of moon farming will be accepted. It's more of the moon farming that goes too far that will need to be dealt with."

Tether themselves recently hired the major New York based PR firm 5W to spread positive information online and take down critics, I'm sure some of their operatives are probably on Reddit.

But its absolutely critical you understand the risks behind Tether and especially now with the explosion in reserve liability, breakdown in relationship with banks and their auditor and recently announced subpoena. 


#What exactly is Tether and what happened so far?

Tether is a cryptocurrency asset issued by Tether Limited (incorporated in the British Virgin Islands and a sister company of Bitfinex), on top of the Bitcoin blockchain through the Omni Protocol Layer. It is meant to give people a ""stablecoin"", for example a merchant who accepts bitcoin but fears its volatility could shift bitcoin into tether, which can be easier to do than exchanging bitcoin for dollars. Recently they've also added an Ethereum-based ERC20 token. Tether Ltd claims that each one of the tokens issued is backed by actual US dollar (and more recently Euro) reserves. The idea is that when a business partner deposits US dollars in Tether’s bank account, Tether creates a matching amount of tokens and transfers them to that partner, it is NOT a fractional reserve system.

Tether makes the two following key promises in its whitepaper on which the entire premise is build:

> Each tether issued will be backed by the equivalent amount of currency unit (one USDTether equals
one dollar).

>Professional auditors will regularly verify, sign, and publish our underlying bank balance and financial transfer statement.

Tether is centralized and dependent on your trust of Bitfinex/Tether Limited, and that the people behind it are honest people. For the new entrants to this market it will be greatly beneficial understand the timeline of Tether and their connection to Bitfinex.

A brief timeline:

* Bitfinex operators Phil Potter and CFO Giancarlo Devasini set up Tether Limited in the British Virgin Islands, but told the public that Bitfinex and Tether are completely separate. Throughout 2015 and 2016, the amount of Tether stays relatively flat.

* In August 2nd, 2016, the second-largest digital currency exchange heist in history happened, when Bitfinex lost nearly 120,000 bitcoin. Bitfinex never revealed full details of the hack, but BitGo (the security company that had to sign off on the transactions) claims its servers were not breached.  

* Just 4 days after the hack Bitfinex “socializes” its losses from the theft by announcing a 36 percent haircut for almost all of its customers. In return, customers receive BFX tokens, initially valued at $1 each. 

* Two weeks after the hack Bitfinex announces it has hired Ledger Labs, to investigate the theft and perform a financial audit of its cryptocurrency and fiat assets. The public nevers sees the results of the investigation, and months later, Bitfinex admits it never actually hired Ledger Labs to perform an audit to begin with.   

* In May 2017, after long standing calls for an actual audit, Bitfinex hires Friedman LLP to ""complete a comprehensive balance sheet audit.""

* November 7, 2017: Leaked documents dubbed “Paradise Papers” reveal Bitfinex and Tether are run by the same individuals.

* November 19, 2017: Tether is hacked, with 31 million USDT suddenly disappearing. Tether Limited reacts to this by creating a hard fork.

* December 4, 2017: Right after hiring the PR firm 5W to help improve their image, Bitfinex hires law firm Steptoe & Johnson and threatens legal action against critics.

* December 6, 2017 - CFTC issues a subpoena to Tether and Bitfinex. This news isn't made public until the end of January. 

* December 21, 2017 : Without making any formal announcement, Bitfinex appears to suddenly close all new account registrations. Those trying to register for a new account are asked for a mysterious referral code, but no referral code seems to exist.

* After a month of being closed to new registrations, Bitfinex announces it is reopening its doors, but now requires new customers to deposit $10,000 before they can begin trading.

* Friedman LLP completely cut ties with Tether on January 27, 2017.

#Most common misconception: Tether is only a small part of the total market cap

One of the most common misconception people have about cryptocurrencies is that the ""market cap"" amount they see on CoinMarketCap.com is actually the amount of money that is invested in each coin. 

I often hear people online dismiss any issue with tether by simply claiming its not big enough to cause any effect, saying ""Well Tether is only $2.2 billion on CoinMarketCap and the market is 400 billion, its only 0.5% of the market"". 


But this misunderstands what market capitalization for cryptocurrency is, and just how different the market cap for Tether is to every other token. The market cap is simply the last trade price times the circulating supply. It doesn't take into account the order book depth at all. The majority of Bitcoin (and most coins) are held by those who either mined or purchased for a very low price early on and simply held on as very small portions of the total supply was rapidly bid up to their current price.

An increase in market cap of X does NOT represent an inflow of X dollars invested, not even close. A 400 billion dollar market cap for crypto does NOT mean that there is 400 billion dollars underwriting the assets. Meanwhile a 2 billion dollar Tether market cap means there should be exactly $2 billion backing up the asset.

Nobody can tell for sure exactly how much money has been invested in cryptocurrency market, but [analysts from JPMorgan](https://www.zerohedge.com/news/2017-12-02/jpmorgan-has-some-bad-news-bitcoin-bears) found that there was only net inflow of $6 billion fiat that resulted in $300 billion market cap at the time. This gives us a roughly 50:1 ratio of market cap to fiat inflow.  Prominent crypto evangelist Julian Hosp [gives the following estimate](https://www.businessinsider.com.au/heres-why-market-capitalisation-is-a-bad-way-to-measure-a-cryptocurrencys-value-2018-1): ""For a cryptocurrency to have a market cap of $1 billion, maybe only $50 million actually moved into the cryptocurrency.""

For Tether however the market cap is simply the outstanding supply, 2.2 billion USDT is actually equal to 2.2 billion USD. In order to get $50 USDT you have to deposit $50 real U.S. dollars and then 50 completely new tokens will be issued, which never existed before on the market.

What is also often ignored is that Bitfinex allows margin trading, at a 3.3x leverage. Bitfinexed did an excellent analysis on how tether is entering Bitfinex to fund margin positions

There are $2.2 billion in Tether outstanding and the current market cap of the entire market is $400 billion according to CoinMarketCap. You can actually calculate Tether as a % of total fiat invested in the market according to the JP Morgan estimate, the following table outlines for a scenario of no margin lending and 15/25% of tether being on a 3.3x leverage margin account:

Fiat Inflow/Market Cap Ratio | Tether as % of total market (no margin) | Tether as % of total market (15% on margin) | Tether as % of total market (25% on margin) 
----------|----------------|----------------|----------------
JP Morgan estimate (50:1) | 27.5 % | 36.9 % | 43.3 %

Even without any margin lending Tether is underwriting the worth of about 27.5% of the cryptocurrency market, and if we assume only 25% was leveraged out at 3.3x on margin we have a whole 43% of the market cap being driven by Tether inflow.

A much better indicator on CoinMarketCap of just how influential Tether is actually the volume, i[ts currently the 2nd biggest cryptocurrency by volume](http://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/volume/24-hour) and there are even days where its volume exceeds its market cap. 

What this all means is that not only is the market cap for cryptocurrencies drastically overestimating the amount of actual fiat capital that is underwriting those assets, but a **substantial portion of the entire market cap is being derived from the value of Tether's market cap rather than real money**.

Its incredibly important that more new investors realize that Tether isn't a side issue or a minor cog in the machine, but one of the core underlying mechanisms on which the entire market worth is built. **Ensuring that whoever controls this stablecoin is honest and transparent is absolutely critical to the health of the market.**

#Two main concerns with Tether

The primary concerns with Tether can be split into two categories:

1. Tether issuance timing - Does Tether Ltd issue USDT organically or is it timed to stop downward selling pressure? 

2. Reserves - Does Tether Ltd actually have the fiat reserves at a 1:1 ratio, and why is there still no audit or third party guarantee of this?


#Does Tether print USDT to prop up Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies?

In the last 3 months the amount of USDT has nearly quadrupled, with nearly a billion being printed in January alone. Some people have found the timing of the most recent batch of Tether as highly suspect because it seemed to coincide with Bitcoin's price being propped up. 

https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/31/technology/bitfinex-bitcoin-price.html

This was recently analyzed statistically: 

>Author’s opinion - it is highly unlikely that Tether is growing through any organic business process, rather that they are printing in response to market conditions.

>Tether printing moves the market appreciably; 48.8% of BTC’s price rise in the period studied occurred in the two-hour periods following the arrival of 91 different Tether grants to the Bitfinex wallet. 

>Bitfinex withdrawal/deposit statistics are unusual and would give rise to further scrutiny in a typical accounting environment.

https://www.tetherreport.com

I'm still undecided on this and I would love to see more statistical analysis done, because the price of Bitcoin is so volatile while Tether printing only happens in large batches. Simply looking at the Bitcoin price graph over the last 3 months and then the Tether printing its pretty clear there is a relationship but it doesn't seem to hold over longer periods.

Ultimately to me this timing isn't that much of an issue, as long Tether is backed by US dollars. If Bitfinex was timing the prints then it accounts to not much more than an organized pumping scheme, which isn't a fundamental problem. The much more serious concern is whether those buy order are being conducted on the faith of fictitious  dollars that don't exist, regardless of when those buy orders occur.


#Didn't Tether release an audit in September?

Some online posters have recently tried to spread the notion that Tether has actually been audited by Friedman LLP and that a report was released in September 2017. That was actually just a consulting engagement, which you can read here:

https://tether.to/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Final-Tether-Consulting-Report-9-15-17_Redacted.pdf

They clearly state that:

>This engagement does not contemplate tests of accounting records or the performance of other procedures performed in an audit or attest engagement. Our procedures performed are not for the purpose of providing assurance...In addition, our services do not include determination of compliance with laws and regulations in any jurisdiction. 

They state right from the beginning that this is a consultancy job (not an audit), and that its not meant to be assurance to third parties. Doing a consultancy job is just doing a task asked by your customer. In a consultancy job you take information as true from the client, and you have no mandate to verify whether your customer's claims are true or not. The way they checked is simply asking Tether to provide them the information:

>All inquiries made through the consulting process have been directed towards, and the data obtained from, the Client and personnel responsible for maintaining such information.

Tether provided a screenshots of twp bank balances. One of these is in the name of Tether Limited, and while the other is a personal account of an individual who Tether Limited claims has a trust agreement with them:

>As of September 15, 2017, the bank held $60,919,810 in **an account in the name of an in individual for the benefit of Tether Limited**. FLPP obtained an engagement letter for an interim settlement plan between that individual and Tether Limited and that **according to Tether Limited, is the relevant agreement with the trustee. FLLP did not evaluate the substance of the letter and makes no representation about its legality.**

Even worse is that later on in Note 1, they clearly claim that there is no actual evidence that this engagement letter or trust has any legal merit:

>**Note 1: FLLP makes no representations about sufficiency or enforceability of any trust agreement between the trustee and the Client**

Essentially what this is saying is that the trust agreement may not even be worth the paper it’s printed on. 

And most importantly… Note 2:

>“**FLLP did not evaluate the terms of the above bank accounts and makes no representations about the clients ability to access funds from the accounts or whether the funds are committed for purposes other than Tether token redemptions**”

Basically Tether gave them a name of an individual with $60 million in their account according to a screenshot, Tether then gave them a letter saying that there is a trust agreement between this individual and Tether Limited. They also have account with $382 million but no guarantee that this account holds to any lien or other commitments, or that it can be accessed. 

Currently Tether has 2.2 billion USDT outstanding and we have absolutely no idea whether this is actually backed by anything, and the long promised audit is still outstanding.


# What happens if its revealed that Tether doesn't have its US dollar reserves?

According to Thomas Glucksmann, head of business development at Gatecoin: ""If a tether debacle unfolds, it will likely cause quite a devastating ripple effect across many of the exchanges that see most of their volumes traded against the supposedly USD-backed cryptocurrency.""

According to Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at Berkeley: ""You could see a spike in prices in tether-only bitcoin exchanges. So, on those exchanges only you will see a run up in price compared to the bitcoin exchanges that actually work with actually money. So you would see a huge price diverge as people see that only way they can turn tether into real money is to buy other cryptocurrency then move to another exchange. That is a bank run.""

I definitely see the crypto equivalent of a bank run, as people actually try to secure their gains an realize that this money doesn't actually exist within the system:

> If traders lose confidence in it and its value starts to drop, “people will run for the door,” says Carlson, the former Wall Street trader. If Tether can’t meet all its customers’ demand for dollars (and its Terms of Service suggest that in many cases it won’t even try), tether holders will try to snap up other cryptocurrencies instead, temporarily causing prices for those currencies to soar. With tether’s role as an inter-exchange facilitator compromised, investors might lose faith in cryptocurrencies more generally. “At the end of the day, people would be losing substantial sums, and in the long term this would be very bad for cryptocurrencies,” says Emin Gun Sirer, a Cornell professor and co-director of its Initiative for Cryptocurrencies and Smart Contracts.

>Another concern is that Bitfinex might simply shut down, pocketing the bitcoins it has allegedly been stockpiling. Because people who trade on Bitfinex allow the exchange to hold their money while they speculate, these traders could face substantial losses. “The exchanges are like unregulated banks and could run off with everyone’s money,” says Tony Arcieri, a former Square employee turned entrepreneur trying to build a legally regulated exchange.

https://www.wired.com/story/why-tethers-collapse-would-be-bad-for-cryptocurrencies/

The way I see it, this would be how it plays out if Tether collapses:

1. Tether-enabled exchanges will see a massive spike in Bitcoin and cryptocurrency prices as everyone leaves Tether. Noobs in these exchanges will think they are now millionaires until they realize they are rich in tethers but poor in dollars.

2. Exchanges that have not integrated Tether will experienced large drops in Bitcoin and alts as experienced investors flee crypto into USD. 

3. There will be a flight of Bitcoin from Tether-integrated exchanges to non-Tether exchanges with fiat off-ramps. Exchanges running small fractional reserves will be exposed, further increasing calls for greater reserves requirements.

4. The exchanges might slam the doors shut on withdrawals.

5. Many exchanges that own large balances of Tether, especially Bitfinex, will likely become insolvent. 

6. There will be lawsuits flying everywhere and with Tether Limited being incorporated on a Carribean Island whose solvency and bankruptcy laws will likely ensure they don't ever get much back. This could take years and potentially push away new investors from entering the space.

#Conclusion

We can't be 100% completely sure that Tether is a scam, but its so laiden with red flags that at this point I would call it the biggest systematic risk in the crypto space. Its bigger than any nation's potential regulatory steps because it cuts right into the issue of trust across the entire ecosystem.

Ultimately Tether is centralizing one of the very core mechanics of the cryptocurrency markets and asking you to trust one party to be the safekeeper, and I really see very little reason to trust Bitfinex given their history of lying and screwing over their own customers. I think that Tether initially started as a legit business to facilitate the ease of moving money and avoiding regulations, but somewhere along the lines greed and/or incompetence took over (something that seems common with Bitfinex's previous actions). Right now we're playing proverbial hot potato, and as long as people believe that Tether is worth a dollar everything is fine, but as some point the Emperor will have to step out from hiding and somebody will point out they have no clothes.

In the long term I really hope once Tether collapses we can move on and get the following two implemented which would greatly improve the market for all investors:

1. Actual USD fiat pairings on the major exchanges for the major currencies

2. Regulatory rules on exchange reserve requirements 

I had watched the Bitconnect people insist for the last 2 years that everything about Bitconnect made perfect sense because they were getting paid daily. The scam works until one day it suddenly doesn't. 

Tether could still come clean and avoid all of this ""FUD"" by simply getting a simple review of their banking, they don't even need a full audit. If everything was legit with Tether, it would be incredibly easy to have a segregated bank account with the funds used solely to back up Tether, then have an third party accounting firm simply review the account and a bank reconciliation statement then spend a few hours in contact with the bank to ensure no outstanding liabilities are held on that balance. This is extremely basic stuff, it would take a few hours to set up and wouldn't take a lot of man-hours for a qualified account to do, and yet they don’t do it. Why? Why hire a major PR firm and spend god knows how much money to pay professional PR representatives to attack ""FUD"" online instead?

I think I know why.

Do you remember when I said I worked in a bank and they told us to not buy or talk about crypto? Now they officially forced all employees to sell our crypto,2692,opd294,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/opd294/do_you_remember_when_i_said_i_worked_in_a_bank/,Trevigol,1626957804.0,False,FINANCE,t3_opd294,False,1756,False,0.92,"I made a post few months ago saying I work in one of the top 10 banks in Europe and they made some new rules saying we shouldn't buy crypto and we shouldn't even talk about it on social media.

At the beginning they said it was to avoid bad advertising for the bank, because they consider crypto a dangerous investment and if a bank employee talks about it, clients could think the bank support crypto.

Now they updated the internal regulations for employees: **they officially forbid us to buy any crypto and we must sell all our crypto assets before the end of the year.**

By the way, the internal regulations is confidential so I'm not allowed to say it publicly.

Now I'm worried because I obviously won't give away my crypto, but I don't know how to avoid to get fired.

I hope binance and crypto.com don't share their info with my bank (has anyone any news about it?), but I need also a way to keep buying crypto without using my bank account, clearly they can easily discover that I send money to exchanges from my bank account.

I cannot share publicly the document, however here is the translation of the part about crypto:

Now you will know it’s fake too. 

There’s been a huge number of new crypto investors the last 6 months, and so scammers will try and use this lack of experience to their advantage and try and steal your coins. Without testing the email links for obvious reasons, I’d imagine they have “spoofed” the Coinbase login page. So that when you enter your details, they will take copies of them for the criminals to try and break into your account and steal your money.

Other ways to protect against this will be to where possible have 2-factor security on any exchanges you use.

* 525 LINK
* 32 BNB
* 22.7187 ETH

For a total value of $7750. Today it would have been worth $135 924. As a student, that would've been quite life changing.

Thank you for coming to my Ted Talk.




**EDIT:** wow, this got a lot more attention than I thought it would. Glad to hear all your stories and input! Just thought I would clarify a few things, as there are a few common themes in the comments.

• I am not bitter about these trades. They were the inevitable mistakes required to learn about investment for me who had no previous experience of it. You win some, lose some but what’s important is if you learn from it. I’m just happy to be a part of this crazy and exciting time.

• I realize “HODL” is not a silver bullet to investment, or even a good strategy in all cases. The point I was trying to make was more about that patience can be valuable, rather than give financial advice. The tide raises all ship etc.

• $135k is not “fuck you” money and wouldn’t make me crazy rich. But it would’ve been life changing for me since it would’ve been a great down payment for an apartment, something that would otherwise be out of reach for me for many years to come. Therefore, it would be my moon and life changing. Maybe just not in the sense many people in this subreddit imagine or wish for.

Have fun out there and don’t invest what you can’t afford to lose y’all :)"

YOU DO NOT own any Crypto Currency that you buy on Robinhood, you can not withdraw any cryptocurrency you buy on Robinhood, platforms like Robinhood defeat the whole purpose of cryptocurrency.

Robinhood has shown in the past that it is willing to halt trading of securities and certain cryptocurrencies which has caused users to lose thousands of dollars.

If you are new here I would recommend first reading up on cryptocurrency. Don't just jump in on fear of missing out. Make sure that you know what you are getting into first. 

After that you can start thinking about buying cryptocurrencies. You can purchase cryptocurrencies from several popular exchanges/platforms such as Binance, Kraken and Coinbase. You can then either choose to keep your coins on the exchange or the preferable option to create your own wallet and transfer your cryptos there. You should note that there will often be a transaction or a 'gas fee' when moving most crypto's off an exchange and into your wallet which depending on how much of a crypto you own might not make it worth it to move off an exchange.

From there you should bet set, there tons of great past threads on this subreddit about crypto that will probably answer the majority of questions you have so always google them."
"No, cardano is not overhyped.

While the author has some points, most of them can be countered pretty easily. Let me explain

Disclaimer: I am mainly comparing ADA to ETH in this post, and I do not prefer one coin over the other. While I will try to be as objective as possible, for transparency reasons I want you to know that I hold both of them in my personal Portfolio

Let me now list all the arguments people use against Cardano

""ADA doesn't have a working product""

Actually, this isn't correct. First of all, they already have a working POS system, which can't be said about ETH. ADA already has a lot of strategic partnerships, for example the Ethiopian government, which is planning to use a licenced copy of the blockchain to store its students data. 

""ADA has been in development for years!""

Yes, but so does any other crypto, ethereum is still in development, too. This is what makes it great. A working product is a less risky investment, but it also leads to less potential growth. IOHK is developing cardano slowly because they want to get it right and are backing it with research This approach is, in my opinion, the best possible one, as it should eliminate potential fatal errors before a full rollout. 

""ADA is only big because Charles is manipulating its community!""

Charles is engaging with its community all the time, thats right. But he isn't shilling ada. Everything he says is backed by facts, the only thing he is doing is keeping the community updated on the project and providing transparency in the development process. In stark contrast to a lot of other crypto devs, which usually have limited community engagement, Charles is keeping the ADA community up to date, and I am thankful for that 

""ADA will never kill ETH""

It doesn't have to. Multiple PoS chains can coexist, that's the point of decentralisation. Not being forced to use a certain service by a certain company. Charles himself never said that ADA is an eth killer, quite the opposite, he thinks ADA and ETH can co-exist

I am really excited about the future of cardano because I think it is an amazing project with lots of potential. I will keep loading my bags with ada because I believe in it's team and technology

But please take everything I said with a grain of salt, I am just a random person on the internet

SCAM Alert!

Even after the phenomenal crash it was still at a much higher price, so I figured YOLO and decided to keep them forever to see where this crazy roller coaster ride is going to take everyone (irrespective of whether it's a **SCAM or not**).

Fast forward to now, the **ShibaSwap just went live**, and I haven't connected my wallet yet, but there is **no legit way a Swap can offer 52349.29% APR right!?** The discord and reddit channels are filled with people already putting their money in, and I don't have enough Karma to comment or post on them, but hopefully someone from there can see this, and think long and hard before they connect their wallet and transfer their BONE or SHIB.

"So I took part in 14 airdrops reportedly worth '$2,827.90'..",2600,kebssy,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kebssy/so_i_took_part_in_14_airdrops_reportedly_worth/,mortuusmare,1608134410.0,False,EDUCATIONAL,t3_kebssy,False,257,False,0.99,"So we’re all aware of the Uniswap airdrop that took place earlier this year, where some lucky folk woke up to over $1200 worth of UNI dropped to them in their wallet – worth over $3,000 at its peak – simply for interacting with the Uniswap platform prior September 1st 2020. I wasn’t one of these fortunate few and neither were a lot of other people here. I’d see people asking if they were too late for the airdrop, or if there were any other airdrops similar. This gave me an idea:- take part in as many airdrops as possible and see how many had any value to them and report back. The answer may seem obvious to some, but I wanted to evidence it. 

The task was simple, enter ‘cryptocurrency airdrops’ into a search engine and see what came up. This eventually led me to joining several airdrop telegrams and twitter accounts and after a week or so I had applied for 14 airdrop by mid October. 

These projects almost universally required the user to join the project’s telegram group as well as like and retweet a post on the project’s twitter account and follow them. Some would ask you to join their Facebook or Medium page and some would require you to post about them and tag friends in. Needless to say, I used throwaway accounts and didn't take part in any that required to tag someone else. Nearly all of them touted themselves as the next big thing in decentralized finance. These were the projects and what they advertised:

**Name**|**Airdrop**|**Adv. $ value**
:--|:--:|:--:
ArbiSwap | 1000 Aswap | $30
UniSwapx | 500 UNIX | $500
Imperium PB | 100 IPBA | $50
YFIV Finance | 1 YFIV | $360
CryptoTechGiants | 50 USDT | $50
Universe Token | 500 UNIT | $500
yToken Finance | 0.2 YTKN | $4
CeliSwap | 500 CSP | $500
XUNII.Finance | 200 XUNII | $20
Revo Finance | 1.5 RVF | $28.90
Ybull Finance | 0.2 YBULL | $10
YFDiamond | 1 YFD | $25
Xenon Token | 5000 XNT | $50
dEarn Finance | 70 DFI | $700

Now, those of you who have been here a while will know exactly where this thread is going. To others, this should confirm their suspicions. Telegram is abbreviated to 'TG'.

**Name**|**Received**|**What Happened**
:--|:--:|:--
ArbiSwap | 0 Aswap | You had to pay them $2 for gas to get airdrop worth $1.34 (worth $1.11 as of now)
UniSwapx | 0 UNIX | **Airdrop never arrived**, locked their TG whilst heavily pushing presale
Imperium PB | 0 IPBA | **Airdrop never arrived**, Telegram channel locked 2 days before airdrop
YFIV Finance | 0 YFIV | **Airdrop never arrived** but still heavily pushing presale even now
CryptoTechGiants | 0 USDT | Airdrop turned into a competition based on how many people you could refer, TG channel turned into a *signal group* (A.K.A P&D group)
Universe Token | 0 UNIT | **Airdrop never arrived**. Locked their TG and advertised a doubling ETH scam website to their users
yToken Finance | 0 YTKN | **Airdrop never arrived**. TG locked and then sold to 'BinanceSwap'
CeliSwap | 0 CSP | TG locked. Required 0.09 ETH (then $45) to be sent which ""they would send back""
XUNII.Finance | 0 XUNII | **Airdrop never arrived**. TG locked and now advertises other 'airdrops'
Revo Finance | 0 RVF | **Airdrop never arrived** due to ""high gas fees"". No one bought their presale so they created a poll asking why. Still pushing presale
Ybull Finance | 0 YBULL | **Airdrop never arrived**. Locked and ghosted their TG channel before airdrop
YFDiamond | **0.00005 YFD** | They airdropped 0.00005 YFD out of the 1 YFD advertised. TG locked and now advertises other 'airdrops'
Xenon Token | 0 XNT | **Airdrop never arrived**. Deleted their TG channel 
dEarn Finance | 0 DFI | You had to send 0.05 ETH ($25) to them first to 'validate' your address

So. out of a combined **$2,827.90** worth of cryptocurrencies advertised to be airdropped, only one 'project' actually airdropped anything and that was 0.005% of what was advertised which is currently worthless. 

This wasn't a surprise to myself and I am glad to have the actual data to back up my suspicions. 

**FINDINGS:**

 - Based on the Telegram channels of these 'projects', most of the users were from South America and the Middle East. Presumably from impoverished countries trying to find themselves some income.  
 - These 'airdrops' were almost always a front to peddle a presale of their token. This appears to be the primary goal of most of them. They want to sell their newly-minted tokens for ETH, promising their project will get listed on big exchanges 'Soon™'.
 - I only had to provide an email to one project: ArbiSwap. I used a throwaway email. After a couple of weeks I started to receive unsolicited emails from unrelated projects. This indicates that they shared/sold information of their users to other 'projects'.
 - Some of the Telegram channels have been renamed and wiped of all information. The dEarn has been labelled a scam by Telegram themselves. Another has wiped all info and has renamed itself 'Project for Sale' and have made one post stating ""We couldn't raise enough from presale, so we abandon the project"". I am unable to find out which 'project' this channel belonged to. 
 - Some projects seem to work together and promote the other project to their users on TG and twitter. 
 - Airdrop twitter accounts and telegrams don't always promote the same airdrops, indicating that they only advertise airdrops that they're paid to advertise by the 'project'. 

**To any newcomers to the cryptosphere, please do your research before taking part in any airdrops. Your time is worth more than most of these 'projects' combined. If something seems too good to be true, it usually is.**"

So, how does it work? Glad you asked. First, we start with the formation of the head, and most notably, the eyeball. The uptrend into 2021 began to reverse and form the neckline, which ended in mid-February. The long wicks in January, one green and one red, form a level of support perfect for this little guy's eye to sit at. But, the formation of the head + eye do little on their own, so let's move on.

During the massive bull run, we see BTC in a strong uptrend, creating higher highs and higher lows between February and the end of May. These form the iconic scutes, (the bony plates on its back) and lead us  gently into the consolidation phase, the spiked tail.

Before I forget, the rainbow is an often overlooked feature of this highly technical pattern. In order to be confirmed, there needs to be a touch from the candles in the head range, the tail range, and each and every scute. Although we almost didn't get the last bounce from the tail spikes, it managed to eek out two bullish days in a row and close the rainbow.

The most delicate and most important phase is the final consolidation down Mr. Stegosaurus' spiked tail. These choppy movements are volatile and difficult to trade, but somehow the candles managed to outline an exceptionally strong tail.

The nearly 8% swing on the 7/20 candle broke out to the upside of the tail range and confirmed that, beyond a shadow of a doubt, Bitcoin is about to take off and reach ATHs very very soon.

See you all at $75k!"

When you look up info about how to spot a scam coin, one of the things it tells you to look out for is...

###Signs of a scam coin

1. **""Unknown Group of Entrepreneurs are Running it""**

The Federal Reserve is run by a group of ""Unknown Private Investors""

2. **Whois lookup on one of their websites comes back anonymous or unavailable.**

WHOIS look up for UsMint .gov  tells me
""Information not available or no support for .gov""

3. **Shilling you to believe it's real by offering multiple periodic Airdrops**.

We're on our 3rd Stimulus now?

4. **Confusing whitepaper thats overwritten, and difficult to understand**

Anyone ever try to read, and understand Federal Reserve banking laws, or policies?
Some things can be understood but usually it's written almost entirely in Dog Latin, and you're going to need a lawyer to interpret that just like you'll need a fraud lawyer with crypto experience to go over that whitepaper when you're going after that scam coin to get your money back.  It's also INSANELY OVERWRITTEN.  The USD white paper will literally take you months to go over and understand. 

5. **GitHub Source has no supply limit set**(Devs can Mint coins)

Ahhh.... Nah, those private investors I don't know wouldn't want to do that. Besides, that would devalue the dollar, and severely hurt their credibility.

Don't believe everyone who is shilling a coin. Always remember the adage: “If the shoe shine boys are giving financial advice, then it’s time to get out of the market."" Practice DD (Due diligence). Don't ever chase a coin that's gone up so much. Never consider a  miss out on potential profits as loss. Always do your own research (DYOR).


**•The market is not always like this.** Right now, it's a very volatile and bullish market. A lot of all these gains you see are not normal.


**•Please only invest money you are willing to lose.** Don't take out a loan, use rent money or other funds you can't afford to lose. No, seriously, there literally can't be any reasons to ever go against this rule. Ever! Only. Invest. What. You. Can. Afford. to. Loose.


**•Low cap coins, lets say anything not in the top 50 by circulating market cap, come and go like the wind.** These projects rarely stay around, they often can’t launch products, and most die a slow death on exchanges as founders and early investors dump them to zero drying up any liquidity that is there. Becareful with them and do a very thorough research before investing in anyone for the long term. Again, always DYOR.

[FMRI studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51738840_Future_self-continuity_How_conceptions_of_the_future_self_transform_intertemporal_choice) suggest that when you imagine your future self, your brain does something weird: It stops acting as if you’re thinking about yourself. Instead, it starts acting as if you’re thinking about a completely different person.

I **really** enjoyed [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nawgc2/vechain_explained_from_the_perspective_of_someone/) VeChain post last week so I thought I will copy its style and format and fit in the IOTA information I have because I’d like to abide by the rules and that post obviously worked out great in that and other regards, though, *this might be a bit longer*.

Vechain seems to be more than promising and we definitely need more of those quality posts here so shoutout to/u/BrownViking99 really well done mate!

As a data analyst, I have a very special relationship with crypto.

On paper, it sounds like the missing piece of the puzzle that can protect my data, through decentralization and data integrity, but practically, many supposed solutions are too complicated or too expensive for recurring data packages. In my company, we rely on centralized services or our proprietary solutions because they can handle the work cost-efficiently and they have better usability. I believe with IOTA, that changes now.

Why not one of the other solutions?

Examples:

* *Ethereum:*  
Well, if you have a data table with 3000 individual entries to validate (like vaccine records that come in one after another), you would pay $17 each with ETH, for a total of $51,000 in fees. And that would be just one data set from one customer.
* *Cardano:*  
Cardano is a bit trickier. The fee structure is transaction (tx) is a \* size(tx) + b, where:-a/b are protocol parameters and -size(tx) is the transaction size in bytesEffectively a few cents right now. Bigger transactions mean more fees.
* *Vechain:*  
VeChain is between 30c and a few $.

&#x200B;

In the machine economy, we are talking about tens of thousands of companies globally and millions of sets per hour.  **In the data economy with real adoption, every project with fees runs into a ceiling sooner or later, only feeless is feasible.**

So in most cases, a centralized service is cheaper right now. IOTA, however, does it all for free. And I can't be the only developer who sees this.

You can look at it from all sides, IOTA is currently without competition. Here is why:

\---------------------------

# IOTA

Anyone interested in IOTA's applications has had to spend the last few years on the roller coaster of emotions.

Rooting for IOTA is many things, but not easy, until now.

Though it gained some momentum back when most of the drama went down, some controversial figures left the stage and they announced an official solution for one of the biggest if not the biggest problem in crypto, for all projects. The [scalability trilemma](https://medium.com/logos-network/everything-you-know-about-the-scalability-trilemma-is-probably-wrong-bc4f4b7a7ef).

&#x200B;

[The Trilemma: a Blockchain can only have two edges of this triangle. ](https://preview.redd.it/sheydmtzwwz61.png?width=450&format=png&auto=webp&s=a17e15064009df8b5a9b86633c7c0512787c2dc3)

&#x200B;

This is obviously a big deal for this space and some companies already declared IOTA their ledger to build on, but later more.

# What is IOTA?

IOTA is a crypto project for the Internet of Things, for the machine economy, and for an actually unspecifiable number of applications wherever data or values are to be sent securely. This means it can also perform many of the functions of other cryptocurrencies through its capabilities. Whenever values are sent, this can also happen through IOTA. Additionally, data can be sent without even owning the token. Neither requires fees or mining.

So, IOTA is a cryptocurrency, but also much more than that.

When I started looking into it, and I think that’s what you should with all big projects, I noticed that most of the projects have a very specific use case, but IOTA was *a little bit more than that*.

Sure, ultimately the majority are meeting here for investment reasons, but a lot of people, myself included, are interested in the technological narrative for data markets, the social as well as economic impact, because it simplifies our work flow and it will transform major parts of our lives.

*A little bit more than that* \-  it's only logical that a mammoth project like IOTA sometimes comes across as a bit pretentious, considering its history.

&#x200B;

# How does IOTA work?

I think over the years it has become clear that IOTA is choosing a completely new path because the devs and initiators involved have noticed along the way that blocks and chains provide enough bandwidth for most speculation-based applications, but if you think about infrastructural improvements, i.e. a so-called backbone for e.g. the Internet of things,  data markets, or a scalable e-commerce environment you don't achieve nearly enough transactions per second.

Bitcoin currently achieves 7 transactions per second, Ethereum about 15, some other projects with proof of authority like Hyperledger also a few thousand, but these are permissioned environments, which are contrary to a free data and machine economy. Permissioned means, your node has to been validated, a form of centralization as not everyone can participate. The machine-to-machine economy is interpreted by the IOTA Foundation as a free network for everyone.

The tangle, i.e. the IOTA network, was therefore created with the aim of confirming transactions in parallel rather than sequentially because it’s faster.

In the first iterations the idea was 2 for 1 so whoever makes a transaction must first confirm two other unconfirmed transactions with a little local proof of work (one-millionth of a BTC transaction).

The first iterations were rather unsuccessful attempts because of a few things but mainly because the whole system was hung up on exotic design decisions.

The trinary hash signatures (a good but complicated idea for the future) or the Winternitz one-time signature scheme (which was used against the future threat of quantum computers) prevented fast processing of the transactions and also the integration and management of addresses for exchanges and users. TBH, it made IOTA way too complicated to create usable solutions in and outside of corporate environments.

Well, the Foundation has made many concessions in this regard, not always without external pressure. We remember some public executions of IOTA, unpleasant times, but part of history and also part of the change processes that people like me were waiting for.

Now we are here. IOTA has integrated Chrysalis, the latest update and old design decisions have been replaced with industry standards like Ed25519.

I could go on here, but essentially IOTA has become more lightweight, binary, faster, and has been equipped with reusable addresses. Now it’s reliable and usable, simple as that.

&#x200B;

[Chrysalis changes](https://preview.redd.it/u3ea4k8bxwz61.png?width=768&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b94a229a127309139efa3f5b4401f750d7efd3c)

For now, the 2 for 1 rule remains, but with IOTA 2.0, expected towards the end of the year, IOTA will also move away from that and become multidimensional, so that many transactions are confirmed at once, without proof of work.

Also possible, according to their roadmap, are smart contracts, DeFi, NFT's and colored coins. It almost seems as if the base-layer function is not only possible for the IoT, but for a large part of all use cases, including crypto.

Clearly, non-scaling projects like ETH (today) have cost investors and developers a lot of money in transaction fees and due to its technological advances billions of dollars return on investments, so don’t get me wrong, but IOTA would bring about a general improvement that everyone feels - imagine the NFT or DeFi market without fees.  


And just yesterday, Elon Musk declared crypto important but minable projects like Bitcoin not green enough. IOTA certainly wins Internet points here, as it’s one of the greenest that works without mining. This is more important for companies in my realm than people might imagine as sustainable applications and technologies have a better societal and political acceptance, naturally.

# Genesis

IOTA was created non-inflationary no new tokens will be created, and in the crowd sale in 2015 all tokens were sold fairly, even founders and developers had to buy in.

The tokens used by the IOTA Foundation for development were collected as donations and there is no further premine.

The goal of this technology is to scale high enough so that machines can send data and smallest amounts of money to each other, even millions of transactions per second are possible from IOTA 2.0 and then subsequently integrated sharding.  
Let me be clear: For now, and only for value transactions, **IOTA’s consensus is accompanied by a validator node, the coordinator that provides the network with a general direction. A centralized protection onboarding mechanism that is finally gone with IOTA 2.0.**

What really important for developers is: There is already an IOTA 2.0 testnet called Pollen, and the next one, Nectar (feature complete and incentivized step by step) is here very soon. So if you’d like to develop future-proof tech, it might be a good idea to look into that as well.

In fact, the number is much higher, but it makes most sense if you look in the [IOTA archive](https://iotaarchive.com/), there are all collaborations, projects, and also patents (an impressive number) with IOTA with primary sources.

It's probably more in the hundreds.

Let's take a look at the partnerships and collaborations because as a data analyst, there are a few treasures hidden here.

Dell and Intel are working with IOTA on [Project Alvarium](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ltv7E0fJBWI) (Conference with all parties), a data environment, or fabric, to make data trustworthy.

That's a big deal to me, because the data that's in edge environments, at the point of origin (like in sensors), hasn't been trustworthy until now. The fact that the biggest companies in the world are now working on this, with IOTA, shows me that it has a future.

Senseering is a company founded by the elite university RWTH Aachen in Germany. They are trying to apply IOTA's tech to modern production in engineering to secure real-life data.

They are on it since 2018 and many videos to prove its results have [been uploaded](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y-X3mCyta0c). They create tech for Germanies biggest companies such as Bosch, VW etc.

The Object Management Group is a standardization company in Massachusetts that discusses and defines various standards and provides the industry with uniform ISO standards. There are now 250, including CORBA, CWM, DDS or MOF, SysML, and UML.

IOTA is in the process of being standardized and made available to the broad mass of companies and developers, a data standard.

&#x200B;

[Standardization roadmap](https://preview.redd.it/79vz46fexwz61.png?width=1000&format=png&auto=webp&s=96fa6127d3f760625ff6670ca08c214e50bfc75f)

This is one of the most impressive developments around IOTA and for me a huge relief as I don’t have to rely on an armada of proprietary standards of several companies in the future.  


Also interesting, Dr. Richard Soley, CEO of the OMG is on the Supervisory Board of the IOTA Foundation. All in all, [the team](https://www.iota.org/foundation/team) is quite impressive.

# IOTA use cases

In general, IOTA is located in the Internet of Everything.

Everything that is digital can be supported by IOTA whether it’s value or data-based.

*Web of trust*

Whenever data is traded or sent in a trustworthy manner, IOTA can assure data integrity with various frameworks.

This comes into play in the following applications:

\-Self-sovereign identity in the mobility sector or for human ID verification (like a vaccine-passport).

\-Data markets for science, the industry, or mobility use-cases. A self-driving Tesla had to rely on trusted data, a smart infrastructure could offer that.

\-Digital twins are copies of industrial environments that can create data digitally to test and improve parameters. The data generated is valuable.

*Microtransactions*

Microtransactions are a novelty that can bring about many different innovations, such as fairest per-second payments for media like video or music streaming.Even data packages from environmental sensors can be paid fairly so that sensors can finance themselves over months and relieve the academic sector financially.

*Supply and audit chains*

Quite comparable to what VeChain offers, IOTA can offer a safe route for information on global value chains for food, materials, or pharmaceuticals. I think that is quite self-explanatory.

*E-commerce*

Everything that Paypal, Mastercard, or Visa offer today, can be offered by IOTA tomorrow, though, this time without fees for vendors and customers and you own your consumer habits and data generated by it.

*In Crypto*

Not ready today but the basis is set: IOTA will be able to host all kinds of smart contracts, NFT’s DeFi, colored coins, and it can also wrap projects and send them for free. Imagine BTC being sent over the tangle. That would be a true cooperative crypto landscape everyone would benefit from.Additionally, I could imagine that IOTA will become some kind of a fast transaction protocol between exchanges (for traders and everyone else) as the finality is extremely fast and the ledger doesn’t require fees.

*Sustainability*

There is just one planet, resources are scarce and the atmosphere has enough carbon already. IOTA is a green enabler technology that can induce a transition to a more sustainable society where power from your roof can be traded securely with your neighbors. While it’s offering that, it doesn’t have to rely on miners. No oil or coal needs to be burned for IOTA’s consensus. Considering how the political landscape is changing, and society is sensitized towards a more efficient lifestyle, IOTA is in a good position to be not regulated to death, unlike projects that rely on heavy mining.

Jeremy Rifkin talked about his idea of a zero-margin economy that can bring the necessary transition. Every IOTA enthusiast knows this video and so should you (even if you’re not into IOTA).

# My thoughts on IOTA

New technologies not only improve our daily lives, our jobs, and the applications we rely on but also lighten the infrastructural load and optimize the world.

Optimization is one of my main concerns, developers are lazy and want simple solutions that will have a direct impact.

IOTA is that technology for me and Nectar / IOTA 2.0 will hopefully prove it.

I believe IOTA is necessary and far away from only providing this space with speculative qualities.

# Disclaimers

I currently hold IOTA, BTC, ETH, and Vechain - because of the last post ;)  
My company is familiar with IOTA and I make sure they keep it that way.

This is an analysis from a developers point of view and **by no means financial advice, DYOR**

This article got a little longer, thank you for your attention.

Heads up boys: We're on the brink of something massive.,2557,8gz9wc,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8gz9wc/heads_up_boys_were_on_the_brink_of_something/,,1525440853.0,False,PERSPECTIVE,t3_8gz9wc,False,877,False,0.86,"Sup guys,  

I just want to give everyone a heads up that shits about the get real in so many ways and YOU are here early.  Yes, you, the guy that bought in December and thinks you'll never recover from all your losses.

Let's go over a few of the things we know about.

1.  The top talent in the world are leaving their old tech/finance jobs and entering blockchain.  Everywhere you look, we're seeing this.  From hedge fund managers, to JP Morgan/Goldman Sachs execs, to Google execs.  Gee golly, why are the most talented and intelligent people in the world entering crypto? 

2.  Banks are diving balls deep into crypto (mostly behind the scenes).  First the banks ignored crypto, then they laughed at crypto, then they attacked it by calling it a ""scam.""  Now they're acquiring exchanges (Poloniex), about to open trading desks, investing in projects (Digital Currency Group), and are in a race to get in before their competitors.

3.  Custodial Services: I cannot overstate the importance of this.  As I've written before, Coinbase is going to be at the forefront of mass adoption and are going to play a key role in all of this.  They've recently been hiring INSANE amounts of management positions, engineers, and something around 500 new customer service reps.  This is because they're about to roll out their custodial program where every credit union and some participating major banks are going to offer their crypto index fund to their customers.  Baby boomer (and Gen X) Mom n Dad are going to walk into their local credit union to talk to their financial advisor and he's going to offer them a new product that is extremely volatile, however, got a return of about 1000% last year. He's going to suggest 2-5% of their portfolio would be ok to invest and these coins are going to be insured; They will never have to trade for crypto or make accounts on sketchy exchanges to get them, just gets their broker to buy them like any other financial product.

4.  The demand for OTC crypto is insane.  This is why you see Gemini and Coinbase starting their own Bloc trading services.  Who and why is there so much OTC demand?

5.  Liquidity is about to blow up.  If you don't understand what liquidity does for markets/coin value, do a bit of research.  The exchange union is coming, where the participating exchanges share liquidity.

6.  Because of this future liquidity, traditional securities (company shares, bonds) and commodities will be represented by crypto.  This one's going to take some time, but you can see the writing on the wall here.  This is going to be where crypto is in full-fledged mass adoption-mode. 


Unfortunately back in December/January crypto wasn't quite ready for the explosion that happened. Exchanges had to freeze trading, not allow new sign-ups, not enough service reps, low security on exchanges, and the tech in general wasn't quite ready but things are changing this year, 2018.  Sit back, open a cold one with the boys, make love to your smokin' hot wife, go play catch outside with your kids, and enjoy yourselves because we're about to witness history - And your all a part of it my friends.  Cheers!

Crypto has changed my life in a completely different way…it has made me hungry for knowledge. Cyber, networking, blockchain knowledge.

I use to find myself sitting at my computer desk reading random articles from random websites about every single random blockchain that caught my attention. I would invest in a project.... make a little money, then switch to another project... lose a little money. 

I’m not going to lie…I don’t have what it takes to be a day trader…lesson learned.

However, I kept finding myself hungry for more knowledge. I wanted to know everything about everything.

Finally, one day I was staring at my computer….basically broke and feeling slightly depressed due to a downturn in the market….and decided to do something about it. My old ass went back to school. 

Now I’m proud to say, 4 years later, I have recently finished my Bachelors in Cyber Security, Comptia Sec+ and A+ certs and I even finished up my Associates from when I was 18 and dropped out my final semester. Dumb…I know. But I personally know I would have never decided to take this path without crypto influencing me. 

Next time you find yourself staring at coinmarketcap and the price of your coins, try to find what aspects of these coins excite you (other than the lambos) THEN GO LEARN. See if this is your passion. You don’t even have to go to college. You can find hundreds of learning resources online. Go better yourself and help this community grow.

If crypto somehow implodes tomorrow, will you have anything to show for all the time you have spent staring at your computer/phone screen? Or will it all be screenshots, memories, and what could have beens?

"So no one else finds it a bit odd that Verge is actually going up in price in a bear market, after a hack attack, after being outed for paying McAfee to promote it, and after the 1 developer begged for money from his own community to allegedly help pay his taxes?",2546,8apvmz,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/8apvmz/so_no_one_else_finds_it_a_bit_odd_that_verge_is/,DestroyerOfShitcoins,1523193618.0,False,OPINION ,t3_8apvmz,False,859,False,0.88,"First off, before I begin... Verge is a shitcoin.

What problem does it solve better than any of the top 10, what is it's purpose, and why is it worth what it is worth?

If you can't answer these questions honestly, then it is in fact... a shitcoin.

Now, besides all that, the coin was literally hacked last week, and the price of it was actually still going up... in a fucking bear market. Now come on, even if you jerk off to this coin, and spread its greatness all around the interwebs, even you have to admit that it's a bit fucking suspicious right?

Then, the sole developer, living in his moms basement, allegedly, with a bit too much hair on his neck, allegedly, has the ball to tell his community, that he will release news on the ""biggest partnership in cryptocurrency history"" if... you give him millions of dollars.... to pay his taxes... allegedly.

And then he goes ahead, and changes the big announcement date to the 17th of April, which so happens to be the exact day all United States taxes are due... coincidence?

I mean I wish I was making this shit up people, but are people really this fucking dumb, or is the developer actually being trolled himself, and these so called investors are actually just 4Channers waiting to pump and dump this thing like nothing ever seen before?

That's the only explanation I could come up with, that or the whole thing is being manipulated by team McAfee, hence the original push... what say you guys?"

Me: I do not support CitiBank's stance against cryptocurrencies

Me: Will you be accepting transactions related to cryptocurrency?
CC: I'll forward the request to cancel the credit card.
Me: Thanks...

Edit: The amount offered is Rupees 1000 or 15.05 US Dollar. I was getting 0.8% cash back so that was already bad.
Edit2: I cancelled the account because they don't let Debit card or Bank account transactions for Crypto as well. It's not about buying crypto. Action was taken because I don't agree with banks controlling what we can buy with our money. This is happening in India. Not sure about other countries."

Be careful guys, 18,6m XVG already left the fund to Binance and the Verge team said it's to pay Ledger. That's a massive red flag. Now also think that out of the 76m XVG raised, 90% of that was donated by Verge's partner, TokenPay. So, it seems they might be moving the funds donated by normal users to the exchange.

"I built a trading algorithm that detects the most volatile coins on Binance and aims to buy before a potential mooning, other devs are helping making this into a web app.",2502,noxs5e,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/noxs5e/i_built_a_trading_algorithm_that_detects_the_most/,CyberPunkMetalHead,1622446929.0,True,TRADING,t3_noxs5e,False,500,False,0.95," This trading bot will automatically place trades on the Binance exchange by detecting the most volatile coins in a given timeframe.

The project gathered significant attention from the GitHub dev community, and have helped to make significant improvements to the original codebase, and I thought you guys might like it as well.

The code was built with customisability in mind, where each user can modify parameters like:

* Define what % increase constitues a buy signal
* Time elapsed between price checks
* Trailing stop loss / take profit
* Stop buying when the market is bearish

In addition to the core functionality, the algorithm is now able to receive and act on external signals which are fully customisable.

It uses data from Tradingview, and this returns buy signals according to the most relevant indicators. BY default if at least 18 out of 26 indicators agree that it's a good time to buy a certain coin, this will tell the bot to go buy that coin.

The bot also has a newly-implement pause functionality. It essentially analyses 15 moving average indicators and if half of them show that's a bearish market, the bot will not buy during this period.

You can also choose and pick any number of custom indicators from oscillators to moving averages and more. Those require a bit of coding, and I'm hoping to make it more user-friendly in the future but the core functionality is there.

After Colonial paid them the hackers used a simple tumbler to tumble Bitcoin onto an exchange and the FBI was able to track the coins and seize the BTC.

Reduce the karma value by 50% for the daily discussion threads,2485,oylpp9,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/oylpp9/reduce_the_karma_value_by_50_for_the_daily/,CryptoMaximalist,1628180062.0,False,,t3_oylpp9,False,2248,False,0.89,"I have a few issues about daily discussion threads. I'll state those issues, the decision is up to you.

&#x200B;

1. They have huge effect on distributions: Daily threads receive tens  of thousands comments in a single day and approximately 750.000 comments  in a month. According to my calculations (\*not certain) they receive  between 1/3 - 1/2 moons of the total distribution. **Numbers are based on my calculation. They can be wrong or right and they'll be change based on the activity.**
2. Issue: Upvote parties. Upvote parties occur so often in the daily  threads. Moderators do their best but it's almost impossible to moderate  a thread that receives 25-35k comments in a day. Most of those upvote  parties remain unreported, even if they get reported the report result  comes a little bit late due to volume of the sub, so even if they  comment gets removed, their upvotes still stay with them.
3. Spam problem: This thread gets so much spam (shitcoin shills - ads -  karma farming etc.). Again, most of those spams remain unreported and  again, mods doing their best but it's almost impossible to moderate a  thread that receives 25-35k comments in a single day.  For reference, if the daily was its own subreddit, it would be in the top 5 subreddits for comments per day.
4. Off-topic posting: Off-topic posting is against the daily thread  rules but still people keep commenting off-topic. This is also  impossible to moderate due to high volume of comments. 
5. Moon farmers: There are a lot of them. Some of them posts hundreds  of comments in a day and some of them receive hundreds of karma in a  single day from daily threads. This is a big problem. **Moon farmers especially choose daily discussion threads because the comment karma gets 2x (double) karma**. You can see them everyday in those threads with their hundreds of comments. Every. Single. Day.

My solution: **Reduce the karma by 50% for the daily threads.**  This will reduce the incentives for moon farmers and the volume of comments, so moderators can moderate more effective. This also will help  balance the moons ratio. Thanks.

"In their ""Money Explained"" series, Netflix contributes to the ""crypto is a scam"" narrative, without bothering to give a basic explanation of what crypto actually is.",2482,nf9ctt,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/nf9ctt/in_their_money_explained_series_netflix/,tfren99,1621340691.0,False,PERSPECTIVE,t3_nf9ctt,False,379,False,0.97,"A couple of edits in response to some frequent comments I've been seeing:

* This post is about the ""Money Explained"" series, which has five episodes that are (kind of) about money. This is different than the cryptocurrency episode in the regular ""Explained"" series (season 1, Episode 15).
* The point of my post was not to say ""there are no crypto scams and Netflix is lying"". Nor was it to say ""Netflix says all cryptocurrencies are scams"". My point was that, over the course of the series, there were plenty of opportunities to mention crypto in a neutral/positive way, but they only came up in the same breath as scams. This to me seems like unfair representation, especially for a show that was supposed to explain money.

**TLDR: Netflix portrayed crypto as pump and dumps and Ponzi schemes, without showing the legit side or even explaining what crypto is.**

Today I watched Netflix's ""Money Explained"" docu-series. The Bitcoin logo was on the thumbnail so I was intrigued. Turns out that was just clever targeted advertising.

Of the five episodes in the series, crypto was only mentioned in one, ""Get Rich Quick"". The episode covered various types of scams and mentioned crypto on two occasions:

The first was as an example for a pump and dump. They introduced the concept of a pump and dump, then said something like ""this happens a lot with cryptocurrencies"". Then they displayed two newspaper articles with the words ""Cryptocurrency"" and ""Bitcoin"" highlighted. I thought this was laughable for two reasons: first of all, pump and dumps existed well before cryptocurrency. I remember watching Jerry Orbach talk about a pump and dump in a 1990s Law and Order episode. Secondly, if you're going to try and disgrace crypto as a giant pump and dump, why would you use Bitcoin as an example? Fools.

Then they covered Ponzi Schemes. To be fair, the scope of Ponzi schemes that they covered was a bit broader, but they still zeroed in on Bitconnect and Onecoin to really drive the point home. The only positive thing I can say about the episode (wrt crypto) was that they included Carlos Matos' ""BITCONNNNEEEECCCCTTTTTT"", so that was cool I guess. I'm not denying that these are scams, I'm just saying they didn't make any effort to show the legit side of crypto.

All told, they portrayed crypto in a very negative light, and didn't bother to explain crypto at all. They just used it as an example for various scams. In fact, for a series that was supposed to be about money, they didn't actually talk about money all that much."
"This isn't a ""dip."" It's a giant liquidity suck.",2480,kuvpyk,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/kuvpyk/this_isnt_a_dip_its_a_giant_liquidity_suck/,dado3,1610341334.0,False,TRADING,t3_kuvpyk,False,1142,False,0.75,"tl;dr version: The dips are market manipulations by institutional players. Don't panic sell, and think carefully about where you set your stop-losses at least until the $100K mark. 

So I keep seeing people compare this bullrun to 2013 or 2017. But they're wrong. Unlike the inherently speculative nature of the previous runs, this is an accumulative run driven by institutions and high-wealth individuals. They think and act differently, and you need to know the difference.

You may have noticed a pattern of late that an ATH is reached, and then it immediately pulls back significantly. I see people putting it down to ""corrections"" or ""dips"" that you normally see but it's not. It's an intentional market manipulation by those big players.

The problem that they're running into is that there simply isn't enough BTC on the market at any given time to satisfy the needs of the institutions themselves and the clients they serve. They have to find ways to pump liquidity into the market, so this is what they're doing. 

They don't care about short-term trading losses. They're dumping large amounts of BTC in the form of BTC and derivatives to drive down the prices and trigger stop-losses and panic selling. BTC that would otherwise be safely locked up are being released onto the market, and they're snapping them up at (relatively) bargain basement prices.

Then what happens afterward? They've now sucked all the possible liquidity out of the market. It's gone. Everyone they can possibly induce to sell has sold. Which leaves only those waiting for higher prices to sell. And so we hit a new ATH, rinse and repeat.

So how will we be able to tell when it's a real ""dip"" or ""correction."" They've already told us. JPMorgan says their target is $146K. Citi says $300K. And if players like JPM and Citi have set targets, you can bet the others have too. We just don't know where they are. A safe bet is somewhere in between those two numbers.

JPM probably won't wait for $146K to stop buying, and Citi's not going to wait for $300K. If I had to place a guess, I'd say somewhere that would leave them at least a 10% gain (which would be better than an average year investing in the S&P500). That places JPM's # somewhere around $130K and Citi at $270K. Until we're safely past $100K at the very least, they're not going to stop. Continue on with your HODLing no matter what kind of gyrations they put the market through."

The tribalism is a big problem and will get us nowhere. I don't go around downvoting posts for mentioning coins that aren't in my portfolio... seems like I'm the last guy around that thinks that way.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

&#x200B;

Wow, I did not expect this simple post to resonate with so many people and cause this much discussion. This is a good thing, it shows many of us acknowledge this problem. I also was not trying to single out Vechain or Nano, or delegitimize those projects, they are just the first two offenders that came to mind. I know there are many more cryptocurrency communities that the same can be said for but I won't name names, because that isn't the point of this post.

&#x200B;

Let's do something about this. Don't be that guy/girl, don't downvote a post simply because it references a coin that you don't own or a project that directly competes against one of your big holdings. I get it, the same amount of coins that you hold today are worth maybe 10% of the value that it was in early 2018. I also get that you probably consolidated most of your losses into a few projects, maybe even just one that you are the most confident can come back. Cool, good for you, I hope it works out. But don't censor posts simply because they go against an agenda of pumping your bags. It makes us all look bad and no one just coming into this space is going to want to stick around if this is what they are greeted with. Let's try and learn something new  instead of shouting as loud as we can about our coins and silencing those that disagree with us. This is an exciting time to be alive, we can't allow tunnel vision to get in the way of the big picture here. We are all still early, there is still so much to learn and so much to gain from being in this space right now."

* You're still really really really early. Think of it in terms of internet adoption: How many people in your circles are into crypto vs how many of them are on Facebook, and how long did it take from the dawn of internet to reach that stage?

**The price going down is a blessing not a curse because it's so much cheaper!**

If you buy when it's red and sell when it's green, history tells us that you'll likely profit generously.

If you couldn't time the top then you probably can't time the bottom, and you probably won't be able to in the next couple of years, so why are you scared of getting a massive 50% discount?

EDIT: Obviously if you have cash to spare. I'm not suggesting you buy any crypto if you can't afford to buy any. I thought that would be obvious.
___
EDIT 2: So many people saying they don't have any more cash to spare. That's because ""your plan is seriously flawed"". It's in the title. You clearly didn't budget correctly, but you can learn from that and not FOMO everything in all at once next time!"

Bitcoin critic Elizabeth Warren is a virtue-signaling political chameleon and a barefaced hypocrite,2423,ov3uli,https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/ov3uli/bitcoin_critic_elizabeth_warren_is_a/,xcryptogurux,1627721866.0,False,POLITICS,t3_ov3uli,False,890,False,0.75,"Every single line of Bitcoin code written by ""shadowy super coders"", who contribute their precious time and inspired efforts voluntarily without a guaranteed salary, is open for the whole world to access, scrutinize and propose changes to.

However, whose tax dollars keep paying for champagne tree-hugger Elizabeth Warren's sneaky private jet excursions remains shrouded in mystery.

Now if we were to pay our taxes in Bitcoin, through a public blockchain, we would be able to tell exactly whose tax money is paying for Warren's climate-destroying charter flights.

[Corrupt politicians? Bitcoin fixes this.](https://preview.redd.it/tp0rwr4agie71.jpg?width=850&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=530d6c2016989c5bb0448be2dde65e1ca3ef7486)

Warren grew up a dyed-in-the-wool Republican. She was registered as a Republican until 1996. Sure, people are allowed to change their minds, even at 50, or perhaps, she recognized that she'd have more political attention and a better political career by preying on populist working-class sensibilities.

Throughout her political career, Warren has been funded primarily by big tech, owned by billionaires and beneficiaries of the banking system she continually purports to rail against, although curiously, you will find, to little ultimate effect.

During her 2020 presidential campaign, Warren vowed to shun high-dollar fundraising events after transferring $10 million in high-dollar contributions from her 2018 Senate campaign to fund her presidential campaign. She also reversed her position on rejecting super PAC support after realizing that it was hurting her campaign.

The Bitcoin code enables humanity to take our economic fate away from the hands of a powerful few and leverage blockchain as an open, trustless, permissionless, decentralized monetary network to democratically create, distribute and exchange value.

Bitcoin liberates every man from the whims of other men.

If Warren had a legitimate interest, as she claims, in dismantling a system that consolidates wealth and power in the hands of a few, she'd be all over Bitcoin.

But it's all pretentious parasitism. A ruthless Janus-faced ruse to raise political support from the majority by feigning concern for their cause, all the while aided and abetted by the powerful few.

The carefully crafted perception that Warren fights for the common man allows her a position of authority she exploits to keep the common man intellectually and rationally credulous to disinformation, furthering furtively the interests of the beneficiaries of the fiat pyramid scheme.

**Edit:** To address misinformation coming in from accounts that are here to brigade,

Bitcoin is open-source software collectively hosted by a pure P2P permissionless network. There's no scope for any shadowy elements in Bitcoin.

The wealth distribution is admittedly far from where I'd personally like it to be. But it's heading in the right direction. The game theory embedded into the protocol ensures that it does over time.

Most of the large wallets holding greater than 10 basis points of the total supply [here](https://bitinfocharts.com/top-100-richest-bitcoin-addresses.html) are exchange wallets. Decentralized exchanges are still a fair way from being as efficient as centralized exchanges. Hopefully, one day they can be, allowing every user to take ownership of their keys at all times."

Pine, as she goes by, earned so much money she was ""past the point of satiety"" and decided to donate the rest. In total, she donated 5,104 BTC worth $55,000,000,   

http://pineapplefund.org/  

She scoured the web and took suggestions, donating thousands to millions of dollars to verified charities.  

These are the kinds of people we should hold up with praise. I have absolutely no beef with rich or the super rich, but I do think if you earn so much money you can't possibly spend it, you are a special kind of asshole if you don't at least engage in some philanthropy to re-distribute your abundance of wealth.  

EDIT: It's a GURL.  
DOUBLE EDIT: In true reddit fashion, lots of squabbling over whether Pine is male or female. **WHO CARES**. It doesn't matter. Pine donated $55,000,000."
